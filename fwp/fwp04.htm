The picture of content should be complete: <BR>
I sing the happy pickaninnies <BR>
Underneath the Georgia moon.<p>

There should be laughing, tumbling, <BR>
Wild flinging about of thin arms and legs and bottoms.<p>

<blockquote><I>'Tis summer, thc darkies are gay</I><p></blockquote><p>

They are: down on Decatur Street<br>
Two kids climb cartons like Bojangles,<br>
Tap, tap, ta-ta-tap--<br>
Dancing for the pennies of the passers-by.<p>

Let the picture be complete, with all of its fixings: <br>
The jigs, the singing, and the ceaseless play, <br>
The perpetual wide-mouthed smiles.<p>

And: in the paved alleys behind the wealthy homes,<br>
The foragers dart thin wrists in glittering garbage-pails,<br>
Find heels of soggy bread, and unstripped chops,<br>
Topping off the feast with rinds of grapefruit<br>
Or rattlesnake melons snitched from market piles, <br>
With practiced looks thrown swiftly over their shoulders <br>
For their arch-enemies, the cops.<p>

Underneath the Georgia moon . . .<p>

<blockquote><I>M' ole man is on de chaingang<br>
 Muh mammy's on relief</I></blockquote><p>

Down at the Lincoln Theater, little Abe is set free again. <br>
Hears music that gets deep down, into his soul. <br>
"Callin' all cars, callin' all cars," and the prolonged hiss, <br>
"Black Ace. Black Ace." And his thin voice screams <br>
When the tommy guns drill, and the bodies fall, <br>
Mow them down, mow them down, gangsters or G-men, <br>
So long as the folks get killt, no difference at all, <br>
So long as the rattling gun-fire plays little Abe his song.<p>

And the only pleasure exceeding this <br>
Will come when he gets hold of the pearl-handled gat <br>
Waiting for him, ready, in Moe Epstein's.<p>

<I>	Gonna be the Black Ace hisself before the time ain't long.</I><p>

Outside the theater he stalks his pa'dner, <br>
Creeps up behind him, cocks his thumb, <br>
Rams his forefinger against his side. <br>
"Stick 'em up, dam yuh," his treble whines.<p>

The squeals and the flight <br>
Are more than he looked for, his laughter peals, <br>
He is just at the bursting point with delight. <br>
"Black Ace. Stick 'em up, feller.... I'm the Black Ace."<p>

Oh, to grow up soon, to the top of glory, <br>
With a glistening furrow on his dark face, <br>
Badge of his manhood, pass-key to fame. <br>
"Before the time ain't long," he says. <br>
"Lord, before the time ain't long."<p>

<blockquote><I>The young folks roll in the cabins on the floor</I></blockquote><p>

And in the narrow unlighted streets, <br>
Behind the shrouding vines and lattices, <br>
Up the black foul alleys, the unpaved roads, <br>
Sallie Lou and Johnnie Mae play the spies, <br>
Ready, giggling, for experiments, for their unformed bodies <br>
To be roughly clasped, for little wild cries, <br>
For words learned of their elders on display: <br>
"Gonna get me a boy friend," Sallie Lou says; <br>
"Got me a man already," brags Johnnie Mae.<p>

This is the schooling ungrudged by the state. <br>
Short in time, as usual, but fashioned to last. <br>
The scholars are apt, and never play truant. <br>
The stockade is waiting.... And they will not be late.<p>

<I>Before, before the time ain't very long.</I><p>

In the stockade: "Little boy, how come you hyeah?" <br>
"Little bitty gal, how old are you?" <br>
"Well, I got hyeah, didn't I? Whatchu keer?" <br>
"I'm goin' on twelve years old."<p>

Say of them: <I>"Like Topsy, they just grew."</I><br><p>
