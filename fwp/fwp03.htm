<a name="1"><center><h3>1</h3></center> <font color="#666666"><li></font></a>My first lesson in how to live as a Negro came when I was quite small. We were living in Arkansas. Our house stood behind the railroad tracks. Its skimpy yard was paved with black cinders. Nothing green ever grew in that yard. The only touch of green we could see was far away, beyond the tracks, over where the white folks lived. But cinders were good enough for me, and I never missed the green growing things. And anyhow, cinders were fine weapons. You could always have a nice hot war with huge black cinders. All you had to do was crouch behind the brick pillars of a house with your hands full of gritty ammunition. And the first woolly black head you saw pop out from behind another row of pillars was your target. You tried your very best to knock it off. It was great fun.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I never fully realized the appalling disadvantages of a cinder environment till one day the gang to which I belonged found itself engaged in a war with the white boys who lived beyond the tracks. As usual we laid down our cinder barrage, thinking that this would wipe the white boys out. But they replied with a steady bombardment of broken bottles. We doubled our cinder barrage, but they hid behind trees, hedges, and the sloping embankments of  their lawns. Having no such fortifications, we retreated to the brick pillars of our homes. During the retreat a broken milk bottle caught me behind the ear, opening a deep gash which bled profusely. The sight of blood pouring over my face completely demoralized our ranks. My fellow-combatants left me standing paralyzed in the center of the yard, and scurried for their homes. A kind neighbor saw me and rushed me to a doctor, who took three stitches in my neck.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I sat brooding on my front steps, nursing my wound and waiting for my mother to come from work. I felt that a grave injustice had been done me. It was all right to throw cinders. The greatest harm a cinder could do was leave a bruise. But broken bottles were dangerous; they left you cut, bleeding, and helpless.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>When night fell, my mother came from the white folks' kitchen. I raced down the street to meet her. I could just feel in my bones that she would understand. I knew she would tell me exactly what to do next time. I grabbed her hand and babbled out the whole story. She examined my wound, then slapped me.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"How come yuh didn't hide?" she asked me. "How come yuh awways fightin'?"<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I was outraged, and bawled. Between sobs I told her that I didn't have any trees or hedges to hide behind. There wasn't a thing I could have used as a trench. And you couldn't throw very far when you were hiding behind the brick pillars of a house. She grabbed a barrel stave, dragged me home, stripped me naked, and beat me till I had a fever of one hundred and two. She would smack my rump with the stave, and, while the skin was still smarting, impart to me gems of Jim Crow wisdom. I was never to throw cinders any more. I was never to fight any more wars. I was never, never, under any conditions, to fight white folks again. And they were absolutely right in clouting me with the broken milk bottle. Didn't I know she was working hard every day in the hot kitchens of the white folks to make money to take care of me? When was I ever going to learn to be a good boy? She couldn't be bothered with my fights. She finished by telling me that I ought to be thankful to God as long as I lived that they didn't kill me.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>All that night I was delirious and could not sleep. Each time I closed my eyes I saw monstrous white faces suspended from the ceiling, leering at me.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>From that time on, the charm of my cinder yard was gone. The green trees, the trimmed hedges, the cropped lawns grew very meaningful, became a symbol. Even today when I think of white folks, the hard, sharp outlines of white houses surrounded by trees, lawns, and hedges are present somewhere in the background of my mind. Through the years they grew into an overreaching symbol of fear.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>It was a long time before I came in close contact with white folks again. We moved from Arkansas to Mississippi. Here we had the good fortune not to live behind the railroad tracks, or close to white neighborhoods. We lived in the very heart of the local Black Belt. There were black churches and black preachers; there were black schools and black teachers; black groceries and black clerks. In fact, everything was so solidly black that for a long time I did not even think of white folks, save in remote and vague terms. But this could not last forever. As one grows older one eats more. One's clothing costs more. When I finished grammar school I had to go to work. My mother could no longer feed and clothe me on her cooking job.<p>

<a name="10"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>There is but one place where a black boy who knows no trade can get a job. And that's where the houses and faces are white, where the trees, lawns, and hedges are green. My first job was with an optical company in Jackson, Mississippi. The morning I applied I stood straight and neat before the boss, answering all his questions with sharp yessirs and nosirs. I was very careful to pronounce my sirs distinctly, in order that he might know that I was polite, that I knew where I was, and that I knew he was a white man. I wanted that job badly. <p>

<a name="11"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>He looked me over as though he were examining a prize poodle. He questioned me closely about my schooling, being particularly insistent about how much mathematics I had had. He seemed very pleased when I told him I had had two years of algebra.<p>

<a name="12"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Boy, how would you like to try to learn something around here?" he asked me.<p>

<a name="13"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"I'd like it fine, sir," I said, happy. I had visions of "working my way up." Even Negroes have those visions.<p>

<a name="14"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"All right," he said. "Come on."<p>

<a name="15"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I followed him to the small factory.<p>

<a name="16"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Pease," he said to a white man of about thirty-five, "this is Richard. He's going to work for us."<p>

<a name="17"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Pease looked at me and nodded.<p>

<a name="18"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I was then taken to a white boy of about seventeen.<p>

<a name="19"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Morrie, this is Richard, who's going to work for us."<p>

<a name="20"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Whut yuh sayin' there, boy!" Morrie boomed at me.<p>

<a name="21"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Fine!" I answered.<p>

<a name="22"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>The boss instructed these two to help me, teach me, give me jobs to do, and let me learn what I could in my spare time.<p>

<a name="23"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>My wages were five dollars a week.<p>

<a name="24"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I worked hard, trying to please. For the first month I got along O.K. Both Pease and Morrie seemed to like me. But one thing was missing. And I kept thinking about it. I was not learning anything, and nobody was volunteering to help me. Thinking they had forgotten that I was to learn something about the mechanics of grinding lenses, I asked Morrie one day to tell me about the work. He grew red.<p>

<a name="25"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Whut yuh tryin' t' do, nigger, git smart?" he asked.<p>

<a name="26"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Naw; I ain' tryin' t' git smart," I said.<p>

<a name="27"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Well, don't, if yuh know whut's good for yuh!"<p>

<a name="28"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I was puzzled. Maybe he just doesn't want to help me, I thought. I went to Pease.<p>

<a name="29"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Say, are you crazy, you black bastard?" Pease asked me, his gray eyes growing hard.<p>

<a name="30"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I spoke out, reminding him that the boss had said I was to be given a chance to learn something.<p>

<a name="31"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Nigger, you think you're white, don't you?"<p>

<a name="32"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Naw, sir!"<p>

<a name="33"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Well, you're acting mighty like it!"<p>

<a name="34"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"But, Mr. Pease, the boss said . . ."<p>

<a name="35"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Pease shook his fist in my face.<p>

<a name="36"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"This is a white man's work around here, and you better watch yourself!"<p>

<a name="37"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>From then on they changed toward me. They said good-morning no more. When I was just a bit slow in performing some duty, I was called a lazy black son-of-a-bitch.<p>

<a name="38"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Once I thought of reporting all this to the boss. But the mere idea of what would happen to me if Pease and Morrie should learn that I had "snitched" stopped me. And after all, the boss was a white man, too. What was the use?<p>

<a name="39"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>The climax came at noon one summer day. Pease called me to his work-bench. To get to him I had to go between two narrow benches and stand with my back against a wall.<p>

<a name="40"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yes, sir," I said.<p>

<a name="41"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Richard, I want to ask you something," Pease began pleasantly, not looking up from his work.<p>

<a name="42"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yes, sir," I said again.<p>

<a name="43"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Morrie came over, blocking the narrow passage between the benches. He folded his arms, staring at me solemnly.<p>

<a name="44"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I looked from one to the other, sensing that something was coming.<p>

<a name="45"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yes, sir," I said for the third time.<p>

<a name="46"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Pease looked up and spoke very slowly.<p>

<a name="47"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Richard, Mr. Morrie here tells me you called me Pease." <p>

<a name="48"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I stiffened. A void seemed to open up in me. I knew this was the show-down.<p>

<a name="49"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>He meant that I had failed to call him Mr. Pease. I looked at Morrie. He was gripping a steel bar in his hands. I opened my mouth to speak, to protest, to assure Pease that I had never called him simply Pease, and that I had never had any intentions of doing so, when Morrie grabbed me by the collar, ramming my head against the wall.<p>

<a name="50"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Now, be careful, nigger!" snarled Morrie, baring his teeth. "I heard yuh call 'im Pease! 'N' if yuh say yuh didn't, yuh're callin' me a lie, see?" He waved the steel bar threateningly.<p>

<a name="51"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>If I had said: No, sir, Mr. Pease, I never called you Pease, I would have been automatically calling Morrie a liar. And if I had said: Yes, sir, Mr. Pease, I called you Pease, I would have been pleading guilty to having uttered the worst insult that a Negro can utter to a southern white man. I stood hesitating, trying to frame a neutral reply.<p>

<a name="52"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Richard, I asked you a question!" said Pease. Anger was creeping into his voice.<p>

<a name="53"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"I don't remember calling you Pease, Mr. Pease," I said cautiously. "And if I did, I sure didn't mean..."<p>

<a name="54"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"You black son-of-a-bitch! You called me Pease, then!" he spat, slapping me till I bent sideways over a bench. Morrie was on top of me, demanding:<p>

<a name="55"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Didn't yuh call 'im Pease? If yuh say yuh didn't, I'll rip yo' gut string loose with this f--kin' bar, yuh black granny dodger! Yuh can't call a white man a lie 'n' git erway with it, you black son-of-a-bitch!"<p>

<a name="56"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I wilted. I begged them not to bother me. I knew what they wanted. They wanted me to leave.<p>

<a name="57"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"I'll leave," I promised. "I'll leave right now."<p>

<a name="58"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>They gave me a minute to get out of the factory. I was warned not to show up again, or tell the boss.<p>

<a name="59"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I went.<p>

<a name="60"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>When I told the folks at home what had happened, they called me a fool. They told me that I must never again attempt to exceed my boundaries. When you are working for white folks, they said, you got to "stay in your place" if you want to keep working.<p>

<a name="61"><center><h3>2</h3></center><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>My Jim Crow education continued on my next job, which was portering in a clothing store. One morning, while polishing brass out front, the boss and his twenty-year-old son got out of their car and half dragged and half kicked a Negro woman into the store. A policeman standing at the corner looked on, twirling his nightstick. I watched out of the corner of my eye, never slackening the strokes of my chamois upon the brass. After a few minutes, I heard shrill screams coming from the rear of the store. Later the woman stumbled out, bleeding, crying, and holding her stomach. When she reached the end of the block, the policeman grabbed her and accused her of being drunk. Silently I watched him throw her into a patrol wagon.<p>

<a name="62"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>When I went to the rear of the store, the boss and his son were washing their hands at the sink. They were chuckling. The floor was bloody, and strewn with wisps of hair and clothing. No doubt I must have appeared pretty shocked, for the boss slapped me reassuringly on the back.<p>

<a name="63"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Boy, that's what we do to niggers when they don't want to pay their bills," he said, laughing.<p>

<a name="64"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>His son looked at me and grinned.<p>

<a name="65"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Here, have cigarette," he said.<p>

<a name="66"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Not knowing what to do, I took it. He lit his and held the match for me. This was a gesture of kindness, indicating that even if they had beaten the poor old woman, they would not beat me if I knew enough to keep my mouth shut.<p>

<a name="67"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yes, sir," I said, and asked no questions.<p>

<a name="68"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>After they had gone, I sat on the edge of a packing box and stared at the bloody floor till the cigarette went out.<p>

<a name="69"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>That day at noon, while eating in a hamburger joint, I told my fellow Negro porters what had happened. No one seemed surprised. One fellow, after swallowing a huge bite, turned to me and asked:<p>

<a name="70"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Huh. Is that all they did t' her?"<p>

<a name="71"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yeah. Wasn't that enough?" I asked.<p>

<a name="72"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Shucks! Man, she's a lucky bitch!" he said, burying his lips deep into a juicy hamburger. "Hell, it's a wonder they didn't lay her when they got through."<p>


<a name="73"><center><h3>3</h3></center><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I was learning fast, but not quite fast enough. One day, while I was delivering packages in the suburbs, my bicycle tire was punctured. I walked along the hot, dusty road, sweating and leading my bicycle by the handle-bars.<p>

<a name="74"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>A car slowed at my side.<p>

<a name="75"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"What's the matter, boy?" a white man called.<p>

<a name="76"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I told him my bicycle was broken and I was walking back to town.<p>

<a name="77"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"That's too bad," he said. "Hop on the running board."<p>

<a name="78"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>He stopped the car. I clutched hard at my bicycle with one hand and clung to the side of the car with the other.<p>

<a name="79"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"All set? "<p>

<a name="80"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yes, sir," I answered. The car started.<p>

<a name="81"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>It was full of young white men. They were drinking. I watched the flask pass from mouth to mouth.<p>

<a name="82"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Wanna drink, boy?" one asked.<p>

<a name="83"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I laughed, the wind whipping my face. Instinctively obeying the freshly planted precepts of my mother, I said:<p>

<a name="84"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Oh, no!" <p>

<a name="85"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>The words were hardly out of my mouth before I felt something hard and cold smash me between the eyes. It was an empty whisky bottle. I saw stars, and fell backwards from the speeding car into the dust of the road, my feet becoming entangled in the steel spokes of my bicycle. The white men piled out, and stood over me.<p>

<a name="86"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Nigger, ain' yuh learned no better sense'n that yet?" asked the man who hit me. "ain' yuh learned t' say sir t' a white man yet?"<p>

<a name="87"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Dazed, I pulled to my feet. My elbows and legs were bleeding. Fists doubled, the white man advanced, kicking my bicycle out of the way.<p>

<a name="88"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Aw, leave the bastard alone. He's got enough," said one.<p>

<a name="89"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>They stood looking at me. I rubbed my shins, trying to stop the flow of blood. No doubt they felt a sort of contemptuous pity, for one asked:<p>

<a name="90"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yuh wanna ride t' town now, nigger? Yuh reckon yuh know enough t' ride now?"<p>

<a name="91"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"I wanna walk," I said, simply.<p>

<a name="92"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Maybe it sounded funny. They laughed.<p>

<a name="93"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Well, walk, yuh black son-of-a-bitch!"<p>

<a name="94"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>When they left they comforted me with:<p>

<a name="95"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Nigger, yuh sho better be damn glad it wuz us yuh talked t' the' way. Yuh're a lucky bastard, 'cause if yuh'd said the' t' somebody else, yuh might've been a dead nigger now."<p>


<a name="96"><center><h3>4</h3></center><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Negroes who have lived South know the dread of being caught alone upon the streets in white neighborhoods after the sun has set. In such a simple situation as this the plight of the Negro in America is graphically symbolized. While white strangers may be in these neighborhoods trying to get home, they can pass unmolested. But the color of a Negro's skin makes him easily recognizable, makes him suspect, converts him into a defenseless target.<p>

<a name="97"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Late one Saturday night I made some deliveries in a white neighborhood. I was pedaling my bicycle back to the store as fast as I could, when a police car, swerving toward me, jammed me into the curbing. <p>

<a name="98"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Get down and put up your hands!" the policemen ordered.<p>

<a name="99"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I did. They climbed out of the car, guns drawn, faces set, and: advanced slowly.<p>

<a name="100"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Keep still!" they ordered.<p>

<a name="101"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I reached my hands higher. They searched my pockets and; packages. They seemed dissatisfied when they could find nothing incriminating. Finally, one of them said:<p>

<a name="102"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Boy, tell your boss not to send you out in white neighborhoods this time of night."<p>

<a name="103"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>As usual, I said:<p>

<a name="104"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yes,sir."<p>


<a name="105"><center><h3>5</h3></center><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>My next job was as hall-boy in a hotel. Here my Jim Crow education broadened and deepened. When the bell-boys were busy, I  was often called to assist them. As many of the rooms in the hotel were occupied by prostitutes, was constantly called to carry them liquor and cigarettes. These women were nude most of the time. They did not bother about clothing even for bell-boys. When you went into their rooms, you were supposed to take their nakedness for granted, as though it startled you no more than a blue vase or a red rug. Your presence awoke in them no sense of shame, for you were not regarded as human. If they were alone, you could steal sidelong glimpses at them. But if they were receiving men, not a flicker of your eyelids must show. I remember one incident vividly. A new woman, a huge, snowy-skinned blonde, took a room on my floor. I was sent to wait upon her. She was in bed with a thick-set man; both were nude and uncovered. She said she wanted some liquor, and slid out of bed and waddled across the floor to get her money from a dresser drawer. I watched her.<p>

<a name="106"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Nigger, what in hell you looking at?" the white man asked me, raising himself upon his elbows.<p>

<a name="107"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Nothing," I answered, looking miles deep into the blank wall of the room.<p>

<a name="108"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Keep your eyes where they belong, i f you want to be 
<a name="109"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>healthy!"<p>

<a name="110"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yes, sir," I said.<p>


<a name="111"><center><h3>6</h3></center><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>One of the bell-boys I knew in this hotel was keeping steady  company with one of the Negro maids. Out of a clear sky the  police descended upon his home and arrested him, accusing him of bastardy. The poor boy swore he had had no intimate relations with the girl. Nevertheless, they forced him to marry her. When the child arrived, it was found to be much lighter in complexion than either of the two supposedly legal parents. The white men around the hotel made a great joke of it. They spread the rumor that some white cow must have scared the poor girl while she was carrying the baby. If you were in their presence when this explanation was offered, you were supposed to laugh. <p>


<a name="112"><center><h3>7</h3></center><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>One of the bell-boys was caught in bed with a white prostitute. He was castrated, and run out of town. Immediately after this all the bell-boys and hall-boys were called together and warned. We were given to understand that the boy who had been castrated was a "mighty, mighty lucky bastard." We were impressed with the fact that next time the management of the hotel would not be responsible for the lives of "trouble-makin' niggers."<p>


<a name="113"><center><h3>8</h3></center><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>One night, just as I was about to go home, I met one of the Negro maids. She lived in my direction, and we fell in to walk part of the way home together. As we passed the white nightwatchman, he slapped the maid on her buttock. I turned around amazed. The watchman looked at me with a long, hard, fixed under stare. Suddenly he pulled his gun, and asked:<p>

<a name="114"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Nigger, don't yuh like it?"<p>

<a name="115"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I hesitated.<p>

<a name="116"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"I asked yuh don't yuh like it?" he asked again, stepping forward.<p>

<a name="117"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Yes, sir," I mumbled.<p>

<a name="118"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Talk  like it, them"<p>

<a name="119"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Oh, yes, sir!" I said with as much heartiness as I could muster.<p>

<a name="120"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Outside, I walked ahead of the girl, ashamed to face her. She caught up with me and said:<p>

<a name="121"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Don't be a fool; yuh couldn't help it!"<p>

<a name="122"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>This watchman boasted of having killed two Negroes in self defense.<p>

<a name="123"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Yet, in spite of all this, the life of the hotel ran with an amazing smoothness. It would have been impossible for a stranger to detect anything. The maids, the hall-boys, and the bell-boys were all smiles. They had to be.<p>


<a name="124"><center><h3>9</h3></center><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>I had learned my Jim Crow lessons so thoroughly that I kept the hotel job till I left Jackson for Memphis. It so happened that while in Memphis I applied for a job at a branch of the optical company. I was hired. And for some reason, as long as I worked there, they never brought my past against me.<p>

<a name="125"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>Here my Jim Crow education assumed quite a different form. It was no longer brutally cruel, but subtly cruel. Here I learned to lie, to steal, to dissemble. I learned to play that dual role which every Negro must play if he wants to eat and live.<p>

<a name="126"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>For example, it was almost impossible to get a book to read. It was assumed that after a Negro had imbibed what scanty schooling the state furnished he had no further need for books. I was always borrowing books from men on the job. One day I mustered enough courage to ask one of the men to let me get books from the library in his name. Surprisingly, he consented. I cannot help but think that he consented because he was a Roman Catholic and felt a vague sympathy for Negroes, being himself an object of hatred. Armed with a library card, I obtained books in the following manner: I would write a note to the librarian, saying: "Please let this nigger boy have the following books." I would then sign it with the white man's name.<p>

<a name="127"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>When I went to the library, I would stand at the desk, hat in hand, looking as unbookish as possible. When I received the books desired I would take them home. If the books listed in the note happened to be out, I would sneak into the lobby and forge a new one. I never took any chances guessing with the white librarian about what the fictitious white man would want to read. No doubt if any of the white patrons had suspected that some of the volumes they enjoyed had been in the home of a Negro, they would not have tolerated it for an instant.<p>

<a name="128"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>The factory force of the optical company in Memphis was much larger than that in Jackson, and more urbanized. At least they liked to talk, and would engage the Negro help in conversation whenever possible. By this means I found that many subjects were taboo from the white man's point of view. Among the topics they did not like to discuss with Negroes were the following: American white women; the Ku Klux Klan; France, and how Negro soldiers fared while there; French women; Jack Johnson; the entire northern part of the United States; the Civil War; Abraham Lincoln; U. S. Grant; General Sherman; Catholics; the Pope; Jews; the Republican Party; slavery; social equality; Communism; Socialism; the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution; or any topic calling for positive knowledge or manly self-assertion on the part of the Negro. The most accepted topics were sex and religion. <p>

<a name="129"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>There were many times when I had to exercise a great deal of ingenuity to keep out of trouble. It is a southern custom that all men must take off their hats when they enter an elevator. And especially did this apply to us blacks with rigid force. One day I stepped into an elevator with my arms full of packages. I was forced to ride with my hat on. Two white men stared at me coldly. Then one of them very kindly lifted my hat and placed it upon my armful of packages. Now the most accepted response for a Negro to make under such circumstances is to look at the white man out of the corner of his eye and grin. To have said: "Thank you!" would have made the white man think that you thought you were receiving from him a personal service. For such an act I have seen Negroes take a blow in the mouth. Finding the first alternative distasteful, and the second dangerous, I hit upon an acceptable course of action which fell safely between these two poles. I immediately--no sooner than my hat was lifted--pretended that my packages were about to spill, and appeared deeply distressed with keeping them in my arms. In this fashion I evaded having to acknowledge his service, and, in spite of adverse circumstances, salvaged a slender shred of personal pride.<p>

<a name="130"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>How do Negroes feel about the way they have to live? How do they discuss it when alone among themselves? I think this question can be answered in a single sentence. A friend of mine who ran an elevator once told me:<p>

<a name="131"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>"Lowd, man! Ef it wuzn't fer them polices 'n' them ol' lynch-mobs, there wouldn't be nothin' but uproar down here!" <p>
