<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>And what did you do after you got married? Live on a farm?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes, sir.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>What kind of a farm was it?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Just a general farm-cotton corn, oats, and such as that.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Did you buy the farm?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>No; leased from an Indian.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>How much money did you pay for it; that is, lease money?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Two hundred and something a year. Then I did some building on it and cleaned up quite a little land.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Was your father a farmer ahead of you, before you?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>He was also a farmer.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, how long did you remain on that farm?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Let s see--I taken the habit of cleaning up land in Oklahoma at that time. It was new, you know, and would sell out the leases; work a bunch in winter, you know, and sell the leases for the profit that was in it. Sometimes made a profit and sometimes I lose a little, but then generally I tried to make a profit.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes, that is a normal idea.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I stayed--I followed that for 5 or 6 years until that section was cleaned up. It developed awfully quick when it first started there, to about 1916 or 1917, why then it very nearly all went into cultivation.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Is that the eastern or the western part of Oklahoma?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, it is approximately called the central-eastern. It is in the Indian Territory.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Did you make any money on that farm?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, I don't know. We made a living. We did fairly well. We couldn't complain.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>And when did you leave that farm?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I left it the first year. I sold it out after I cleaned it up and built a house and built the fencing; some fellows moved in from Arkansas and I sold out to them in one day. I think I got $1,800.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Cash?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Cash money.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Then where did you go?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>We rented a farm over by what is known as Slick, part of the ground that Slick is on; the town where the oil fields are. It is the oil town, Slick.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>How did you make out there?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, we did fairly good. We had taken what is known in our country as malaria fever and chills. It developed pretty much over the country at that time, on account of the rains.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You have had a good many chills since, after you started to move, haven't you?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I believe so.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN. </b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well now, Mr. Higgenbottom, how long did you remain there?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>We stayed 1 year.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Did you make any money there?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes; we made a little money. We got ahead. We accumulated quite a little stuff around us-generally a farmer does-and we moved from there to another farm about 5 miles from there that belonged to a banker. We did extra good there. We hit a good crop.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You mean to tell me you made a little money from the banker?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>No; not the banker.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>But you got a good deal, did you?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I cleaned up quite a little land for him. It was good land in the river bottom. He hadn't had it developed yet, so I went in there and we cleaned it up. We made a pretty good crop.<br>From there we moved to Kansas where her folks lived. We had taken--we rented a farm there of about 640 acres. It was mostly in alfalfa and in grass, and raised two or three hundred acres of crop. We stayed 1 year.<br>There was a bunch of wheat growers come in from the west. At that time the war was on pretty good, you know, and so we sold out, sold our stock and went back to Oklahoma. I figured we could do better there, knew our country. We rented a farm down close to Muskogee. We did fairly good. We made a good crop, I guess about the best crop there was in the neighborhood at that time; corn and cotton.<br>Then we moved close to Tahlequah, Okla. We stayed there on that farm 2 years and it wasn't large enough, so I moved to another farm and bought a farm at the same time.<br>We moved about a mile and we didn't do quite so good that year, but on our own land we had quite a bunch of cattle. That was about in 1920.<br>We had a free range and we bought quite a bunch of cattle and had them around. It cost us $100 apiece, and there is where the drought caught us with those cattle. Lots of people say if I could look forward as I do backward-those cattle brought me $10 apiece and I give a hundred for them. Of course, I had a little mortgage on some of them and to quiet the mortgage I just sold enough to lack a little of paying the mortgage. I owed a little land note and I didn't have money enough, so I sold two hounds for $165.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Two what?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Two hounds; running hounds.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>They must have been fast.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, I sold them for $165. I sold 16 head of cattle for $160, but two hounds brought $165.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Why didn't you go into the hound business then?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, I did. Just about that time, the time I got into the hound business, the Osage Indians, they didn't have any money to spend. Oil went down.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>The hounds went with them?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>So they quit buying hounds. Hounds like I sold were selling for $10 apiece, and I give some of them away that I raised.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>What were they? Just rabbit chasers?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>No; wolfhounds; fetch wolves. They were running hounds with a pedigree; just a breed of hounds.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>What kind of wolves were there there, timber wolves?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Timber wolves and coyotes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Go ahead.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>We stayed there about 5 years on that farm and we sold it. We moved on a larger farm about 2 miles from there, in the same school district the other farm was in. We put in quite a bunch of-quite a crop, I guess about the largest one there was in the country, and I guess the best. I guess the best and biggest there was in the country. I stayed on that place 4 years.<br>I think I had taken about $1,000 cash on the farm and the last year I was on it, I had 27 head of cattle when we left and I was in debt $500 and I left with three mules and a pony and no cattle at all.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Don't forget the wife and children.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Of course, all this time, why, I was accumulating a little larger family.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, I would say you had made a good showing with your accumulation, all right.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>It had taken. I am a great hand, you know.<br>Now this boy here--we left Oklahoma 3 years ago, and as young as he is, I put him out with a mule, running out in the cotton, and I put them all out; these girls, both of them. All of them, you see, I start pretty young to farming so if I get behind or something, why I let them do the work and they can all handle mules.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You manage to work the wife a little, too, don't you?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>She is generally busy at the house. If dinner wasn't ready, you know what takes place.<br>We moved from there and we went about 30 miles west from there to Wagoner County, and then we started farming there. At the first year I had taken $500 worth of debts and moved them over to this bank, from one bank to the other, like we generally do when we move; transfer our debts to the other county.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>That is a new one on me. You go to one bank and pick up your debt and transfer it to another bank?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Did you have any trouble doing that?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM. </b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, not too much. There is a whole lot to the person. You know the record generally follows a fellow, if he pays his debts.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN. </b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>And it depends on the sort of a front you put up, too, doesn't it?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, I don't know. I talked just as good as I ever did, the last few years, but it doesn't go anywhere.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Then go on from there.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>We made a crop that year; made a pretty good cotton crop and corn crop. Everything was fairly good. The lightning killed two of my mules in one night. There come up a little thunderstorm. Then it was not very long until there was a little cyclone hit through there--didn't hit quite at our place, but it hit--and we had a good horse, about as good as there was in the country, I guess, and he run into-he got excited and run into a tree and broke his neck. That left us with one mule.<br>Well then, I went to buying what is called scrub stock for $10 and $15, you see. I got down to where my credit wasn't good with the back any more because I didn't have any security.<br>So along about that time the plow-up program come.<br>You see the reason that I always get the children to help me, we all work together. If I am out in the field, my shadow amounts to a whole lot out in the field. I always try to stay out with them, because maybe they get tangled up with the horses or something when they were working, but it is not long until they can go along.<br>Along about that time they come through with the cut on the cotton acreage. They cut the cotton acreage. On the farm I was farming, it was just adapted to cotton. That was a cash crop. You see, we farm corn, wheat, and oats just enough, you know, and we didn't want to get into it very large on account of it cost so much for machinery. I have the hands to handle the cotton, and it requires quite a little work.<br>Let us see, in '28 it was--I am going back--the reason I left over there was that I didn't make anything. It rained the entire year. Just before we moved to Wagoner it rained the entire year there. The corn was awfully good, and the wheat and the oats that I had, about 150 acres of wheat, and all that, were good; but the rain wouldn't let you get in the field and cut it. It just fell down. And the cotton, in the rainy season, the boll weevils worked awfully bad at that time. On 35 acres of cotton I finally picked out a bale of cotton. On 10 acres I never got a bloom on it on account of the weevils. But we had tended it good before we knew it wasn't going to make anything.<br>So I lost my wheat and other crops and the weevils ate up everything on it except the mortgage. I had a pretty good mortgage on it. The banker, he held the mortgage and was a little luckier. He had the mortgage in a safe place. That was the reason why I had taken and I sold my cattle. Then I moved to this Wagoner County, Okla.<br>So that was the year that my horses died. I stayed there on that place. In '33--I will go on up to the story where I was--in '33, I think it was along about that time, why I got a pretty good bunch of cotton hands. We could really go to town on it. We raised it and we generally had the finest flower garden in the country. The girls come in at noon and I had seen them, they would grab the hoe and go out and handle the flowers. We had the finest flower garden that I seen anywhere. In fact I made a trip to Indiana and back and I didn't see as nice a flower garden. The girls did that while they were resting at noon from hoeing cotton.<br>Along about 1933, I think it was, they had--you know, they called the cotton reduction. Well, on this farm, why they cut my cotton. I generally raised about 40 or 45 acres of cotton and I put in for it, told them how much cotton I raised--the truth. I always got by the bank with the truth pretty well, found out it generally paid. But on this occasion, why there were several in the field, you know, that were in the country, and when the cotton acreage came out it was nearly twice as large as ever had been planted in the county. I seen then I was hooked. I wasn't a very good hand to stay in the game or I wasn't a good liar. Well, when they come through, they caught the fellow that told the truth and they cut his acreage down, which had taken mine down half or very near half. Then they give it another reduction. But many fellows in there, probably that maybe planted 4 or 5 acres of cotton said they had planted 50 and 100, because they seen what the Government pay-off was, and everything, saw that it was a paying proposition, and they wanted lots of cotton. You see) there was no check-up that was given, much.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Anyway, you didn't make it go there, is that right? I am kind of anxious to get you started toward California if I can. I want you to tell me why you are in California.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>So when the cotton acreage was cut, my children--I finally landed with 16 acres of cotton, with a big family that could do the work, you know, on approximately 40 or 50 acres of cotton, and do the other work growing the living, which we had to have--I can raise cotton a lot cheaper than you can if you hire the work done on that basis. I did that in order to keep my children at home and, of course, if I was going out here and hire a lot of work done, on the cotton, I wouldn't go at it that way. But in order to keep my children to home, I can work them at home and they would all be at home and we could raise largely our own living, but it takes some money.<br>The cotton acreage was cut and a couple of the older children says there is no use of staying there. "We will go hunt us a job." Of course, that thronged a little extra labor on the market, as two of them left home. But I always want to keep my children home. They have never been back since they left, since they left home. They stayed away. One of them went to Arizona to pick cotton and stayed his 6 months and came back for a little while but no more. There wasn't no work at home because we could handle the 16 acres of cotton just, you might say, a one man's job.<br>Then we moved from that place. We moved from there to another place about 5 miles from there.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>In Oklahoma?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>In Oklahoma. The first year--it was '36--it was the drought all over the country. We didn't make anything. We had a few potatoes. We made quite a crop of potatoes. They were a fairly good price and would keep us from starving to death. In the fall we hooked up the truck and went to Texas to pick cotton. We left the family there to do the work and we left quite a little canned stuff and fruit and they had milk and butter and everything. We come back and we were hunting location. That is what we were hunting. We want to get somewhere where we might farm. We didn't want to sell our crop or teams and stuff, so we went to Texas and we picked cotton. Texas was somewhat of a failure, too. We didn't make too good. We made our expenses and come back. Not any better off than when we left.<br>So in '37--'36 and '37--why we made nothing.<br>That winter--we generally keep quite a bunch of chickens and milk cows and hogs around--we come back and we started in to make another crop and I put in for the F. S. A. loan. I went to Muskogee and I got a producer's loan. I already had that on this crop, you know, and it didn't pay off anything so I had to get an F. S. A. loan for feeding.<br>Well, there was nothing made. The chickens, along in January and February--it was awfully cold--we lost, I guess, two or three hundred chickens that starved to death. You could go out and see them. We lost one mule, one cow, just on starvation. You know that don't look good to a farmer, so I made up my mind then that it was--we got our F. S. A. loan after we got most of our crop planted and it was a big help when we got it, of course, but we didn't get it in time. If I could have got that loan to have bought feed, you know, the 1st of January, I could have put the chickens to producing and went on. But everything went against me.<br>So I says, "Well, now, this is our last crop. I will never see anything else that I have got starve to death."

<td align=left valign=top width=450>Was it cold?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, it wasn't so cold. It. was dusty, you know. That dust--we would have to carry water and sprinkle down on the ground to keep the dust from rising, and then the wind would sometimes blow the tents over. But we fixed ours pretty solid.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You had to carry your water, you say?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, yes, sir; a couple of hundred yards. The reason we did that, in order to keep from being in the main camp where probably there was two or three hundred Mexicans and Negroes, all lived side by side in there--two or three families moved out on the desert. We had to carry water.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>They was the earliest, I think. There was lots of brush down through the country. If we wanted to change clothes, and if there was anybody around, we had to go down there--if we wanted to go to town or anywhere--we would go over down by the brush there and change clothes and come back and go to town.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>We were there until in January. We was there when they quarantined us for smallpox.<br>You see, the smallpox come through there and we could walk around in the field, you know. This fellow was quite a cotton farmer, and my bunch was vaccinated--or that is, we thought they were all vaccinated from smallpox at Gilbert, in the schools, and so we had these smallpoxes. They would come out in the field. They was just as scabby as goats, you know, picking the cotton. The people would tell the health officers.<br>Well, the fellow had his way for getting rid of those kind of fellows. It was to fire them. When they would break out with smallpox he would fire them. He couldn't use them any longer. That would keep him from losing his cotton camp.<br>Well, they would go over to some other cotton camp. Finally I kept this girl here from school. She was--her head, you might say, was a solid scab; just broke out with smallpox, and here comes the school fellow, you know, "You got to send her to school in the morning. You see that she is in school."<br>We were keeping them out of school once in a while to pick cotton, and I don't blame him for kind of kicking up a fuss. We would have to get up the grocery bill. Some days we got to do work and sometimes we wouldn't. <br>He was gone about an hour or 2 hours and here the health officer brought her back. "You keep that girl from school. Why didn't you keep her out? You have had the whole school quarantined over here."<br>Well, I said, "That is too bad." They quarantined the camp then over this. We was under quarantine 21 days and they fed us.<br>The way they issued groceries there, the fellow that was "abatching" in a tent, he got just as many groceries as a fellow with 15. Everyone got so much. We got about enough to maybe get a meal if we could eat it. I know we got some bacon one time--they was pretty liberal with us, they gave us some bacon--and we boiled it with beans. We couldn't eat it any other way. We thought it would season the beans, which it did. We went to cut it and you could stick a fork in it and push it out over the plate. We figured it wasn't much to eat so we threw it out. The wolves would come up within 20 feet of your tent and howl of a night. We always figured they--

Peas was only 16 cents a pound.<br>Then we went to Beaumont and picked cherries there, and lived in the Government camp there. From there we went to Thornton, Calif., up north here. We found very little work there. The Filipinos were doing the most of the work there in the tomatoes. We worked a little in hay and then we went to San Jose and worked in the apricots. Then we went back to Thornton and thought we would work in the tomatoes, but the Filipinos and the Japanese got all the good tomatoes, which I guess they know how a little more than the average fellow.

<td align=left valign=top width=450>The 12th of February 1939.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>That was the first time you ever came to California?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I would like to ask one other question: Have you ever used a California State Employment Service, the employment offices where you apply when you are out of a job?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes, sir; I tried to use them.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You tried to use them? Why weren't you successful in using them?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Now last spring I had got registered in Beaumont. I went to the employment agent there at El Centro. One has to be put on the list as a combine man, which I am, a farmer, and I understand machinery, farming machinery. He told me, he says, "We can't register you. We keep this for home people," and which he was right, I guess. But I got a job on a combine there and worked.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>This was in Beaumont Calif.?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>This was in El Centro.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>He would not accept your application as a combine worker, though you are a competent combine worker?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Now the reason I asked that question was this: You told the committee that on several occasions you would go to different areas in search of employment and when you got there there was no work. I think you mentioned that the Filipinos had all the work and there wasn't any there. I was wondering if you had used a California State Employment Service whether you could have avoided that. They might have records in their office--I don't know whether they do--but they might have records that would have told you whether there was any pea picking or tomato picking in the different places that you went to.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>At one time we used the employment office at San Jose to go out on a job, but it proved worthless, you know. The employment offices in some cases are used, you know, in order to get a fellow out on jobs that are worthless. That is the way.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I am talking about public employment offices now. I am not talking about those people who make a charge or something like that, because they would have some interest in getting you out.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>This was in a public employment service. Of course, they didn't know what kind of a job that we would get out on, but it was planned to be--it proved to be worthless as far as money-making was concerned.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Was the money you made on the job less than they led you to believe it was going to be?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, I don't know as it was. The job--

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS (interrupting).</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I am trying to get the facts. I want to clear them or involve them, one or the other.<br>Did they misrepresent it, or didn't they?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, I don't know. I wouldn't say.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You wouldn't say that they had misrepresented it?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I wouldn't say.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>That is all I have, Mr. Chairman.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. SPARKMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>That was the employment office at San Jose?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes, sir.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. SPARKMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>That is the only experience you have ever had such as that?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>He had one other experience with an employment agency.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. SPARKMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>That is all.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Mr. Higgenbottom, are you glad you came to California?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes, sir.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Do you want to go back home to Oklahoma?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, no; I don't believe I do. I have better health here than I had back there.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You have better health?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>The children are all well, are they?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Are they all going to school?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Three of them are.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well now, if you had a farm and could make it go back in Oklahoma, would you try to live there?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I don't know. We have had so many failures I would be afraid to risk it again.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>There comes a time when people down there in the dust bowl area can't make it go, and rather than starve standing still they get out and move? Don't you think that is the idea?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes, sir.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Was there anything else that you have in mind that you haven't told us? I think you have covered it very well.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Mr. Higgenbottom, do you consider yourself a Californian today or an Oklahoman?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Well, I don't know. The California people have always treated me mighty nice. I will have to say that.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Then you would consider yourself a Californian?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I think that a great many Californians misuse the word "migrant". I think that it should be "immigrant" and not "migrant" because most of the people that come here expect to stay. Isn't that true, as to those that you have met working around?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>I think there is a large percent of them that intend to stay. You see, the wages in Oklahoma--they are so scarce and there is so little, you know, 50 cents a day there is about the wage scale on the farm. You could put up a sign on a post--I did on potato-picking--at 75 cents a day, and I think there was 100 come and I only needed 20. I didn't think about getting the whole country in; 75 cents a day to pick up potatoes, and they pick cotton at 15 cents a hundred, which is generally the scale of wages.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You mean back there?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. OSMERS.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>And here?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Here it is 85. You see, probably the cheaper wages there drives people out. Now, I know that has a tendency, to make money, you know, if you can get the work done for nothing, why of course you can afford to farm. That has caused a lot of farmers to develop their acreage, the large farms, to develop their acreage.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>According to the census figure in the last 10 years, a million people have moved out of the Great Plains States, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas. We have had testimony introduced in bearings at Oklahoma and Lincoln, Nebr., by experts showing that 5,000,000 acres of land in the Great Plains States have 25 percent of the topsoil gone.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. TOLAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>You believe that?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes. It is fully that much.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. TOLAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>In other words the soil in some of those Southern States isn't getting any more fertile and it is just going the other way, isn't it?

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>Mr. HIGGENBOTTOM.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Yes.

<tr><td align=left valign=top width=150><b>The CHAIRMAN.</b>
<td align=left valign=top width=450>Now, Mr. Higgenbottom, we thank you, and you, too, Mrs. Higgenbottom. You are a pretty fine family, and I am proud of you because we have heard a lot of eastern families testify and I think you are right up with the best of them. I hope you have a lot of good luck with the family and that you make your farming stick. Thank you very much.
