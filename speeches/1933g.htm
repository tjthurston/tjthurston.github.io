<ol><I>Dr. MacCracken, my old friends and all neighbors of old Dutchess:</I><p>

<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I am glad that Dr. MacCracken referred to introducing Dutchess County to the United States. <p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I think it is a very fine idea, but as a matter of fact, way back in the old days, when I ran at another time on the national ticket in 1920 and began to know the United States, one of the amazing things to me was that there was hardly a State west of Ohio, clear on out to the Pacific, where I did not meet somebody in the crowd, or at the luncheon or at the banquet, who would come up to me and say: "My family came from Dutchess County in the old days."<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Dutchess County has spread all over the United States; and the influence of the fine old stock that we have raised here is being felt in our American citizenship in every part of the country.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I want to go back for a minute to the old days before I got to know the United States. It is, I think, just twenty-three years ago that I chanced to be in Poughkeepsie on a Saturday morning in August-a very hot Saturday morning.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> In front of the court house I ran across a group of friends of mine. As I remember, they were Judge Morschauser, George Spratt, John Mack and Judge Arnold. I had only intended to stay in town for a few minutes to do some errands, but they kidnapped me - one of the first cases of deliberate kidnapping on record - and took me out to the policemen's picnic in Fairview.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> On that joyous occasion of clams and sauerkraut and real beer I made my first speech, and I have been apologizing for it ever since.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> And also on that same occasion I started to make the acquaintance of that part of Dutchess County that lies outside of the town of Hyde Park.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> And I continued to make that acquaintance all through the campaign that year, although in August I hadn't the foggiest idea that I was going to run for the State Senate; and it was only because another band of kidnappers kidnapped me that I got into public life at all.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> For I had to talk, and I was given the opportunity of making the acquaintance of a county.<p>

<a name="10"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> And today, as I drive along a beautiful concrete highway, or one of the new county roads, I see in my mind's eye that same road as it existed in the autumn of 1910 as I proceeded over it at the dangerous pace of about twenty-two miles an hour in Mr. Hawkey's old red Maxwell, without any front windshield, without any top - an old Maxwell that when we met a horse or a team - and that was about every half mile or so - we had to stop, not only the car, but the engine as well.<p>

<a name="11"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> All through all those succeeding years the friendships that we began at that time have deepened, and, as you know, in spite of absences in Washington and in Albany, I come back to the county on every possible occasion with a true feeling that it is home and that I am once more among my neighbors.<p>

<a name="12"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I get the local papers down in Washington, and judging by them I can say that during these recent months I have taken deep satisfaction in the fine spirit of understanding with which the people of my home county have gone along with the great national effort to set our national house in order.<p>

<a name="13"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> In former days in this State and in other places we have seen something of the same performance in the fields of local government.<p>

<a name="14"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Here and there, in spots that are altogether too rare, there is a town or a city or a county or even a State that has, through the interest of its own citizenship, become conscious of the fact that under the old order the social, economic or political life of the community was drifting down hill either through lack of  action or through adherence to old rules promulgated to fit   conditions of a bygone age.<p>

<a name="15"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> In such cases, aroused citizens have chosen new public servants   or have changed the form of conducting their local affairs to the   advantage of the community, without destroying the principles of   self-government that are inherent in our American civilization.<p>

<a name="16"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> You and I know that history in this State and elsewhere gives us   many local examples of that. In a sense, this arousing of people's   interest is what has occurred throughout the country in this year   1933; and it has made itself felt in the national capital.<p>

<a name="17"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I think it is the first time in our history that the Nation as a whole,   regardless of party, has approved such drastic changes in the   methods and forms of the functions of government without   destroying the basic principles.<p>

<a name="18"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Perhaps I can best illustrate the change that I am talking about by   putting it this way-that have been extending to our national  life the  old principle of the local community, the principle that no  individual,  man, woman or child, has a right to do things that hurt his   neighbors.<p>

<a name="19"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> And this being neighbors' day, I think we can properly emphasize   that word.<p>

<a name="20"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Many any centuries ago, as you know it was the principle of the   old English common law - nearly l,000 years ago and its   development has been constant and consistent - to be fair to one's   neighbors and not do things that hurt them.<p>

<a name="21"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> In the old days, when there were only agricultural communities,  it  was unfair, for example, to our neighbors to allow our cattle to   roam on our neighbors' land. We were told we had to fence in  our  cattle.<p>

<a name="22"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> And then when we got into great cities it became unfair to   maintain. let us say, a pigsty on Slain and Market Streets.<p>

<a name="23"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> As this principle was extended, it became unfair to our neighbors   if we - any individual or association of individuals sought to make  unfair profits from monopolies in things that everybody had to use, such as gas and electric lights and railroad tickets  and  freight rates and things of that kind.  <p>

<a name="24"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Still later on, it became uniformly accepted throughout the   country, almost, that it was not fair to our neighbors to let anybody   hire their children when they were little bits of things, when they   ought to be at school, and especially that it was unfair to hire them   at pitiful wages and with long hours of work.<p>

<a name="25"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Many years ago we went even further in saying that the   Government - State Government or national Government - would  have the  right to impose increasing taxes on increasing profits  because of a  simple principle that very large profits were made at  the expense of  neighbors and, therefore, should at least to some  extent be used  through taxes for the benefit of the neighbors.<p>

<a name="26"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Now the extension of the idea of not hurting our neighbors is   recognized today as no infringement on the guarantee of personal   liberty - personal liberty to the individual.<p>

<a name="27"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> For example, it is no more a restriction to tell a man that he must   pay adequate wages than it is to tell that man that he must not hire   child labor, or that he must not maintain a nuisance against his   neighbors.<p>

<a name="28"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I think it is within this understanding of the deeper purposes of   things today that the National Recovery Act we have heard so   much about is proceeding, and that that Act is being accepted by   the people of the country with the understanding of what it is all   about.<p>

<a name="29"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Of course, it is true that your Government in Washington hopes   that the building up of wages that are too low that are starvation   wages and the shortening of hours of work hours that are too  long,  in every part of the Union, will result in a greater distribution  of  income and wages and will thereby increase the number of  people  in this country that can be employed.<p>

<a name="30"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> It is true that we in Washington are seeking definitely to   increase the purchasing power of the average American citizen and, therefore of the Nation as a whole.<p>

<a name="31"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> It is also true, I think, that we are definitely succeeding in this purpose and that the downhill drift of America has definitely turned, and has become the upward surge of America.<p>

<a name="32"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Now, my friends, that is a matter of dollars and cents. But it is also true that the people, through government, are insisting as a permanent part of American life - not just for one year or two years - that individuals and associations of individuals shall cease doing many things that have been hurting their neighbors in bygone days.<p>

<a name="33"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> We are engaged today, as you know - not just the Government in Washington, but groups of citizens everywhere - in reviving all kinds of human relationships, and in making these reviews we are asking an old question in a new form. We are saying, "Is this practice, is this custom, something which is being done at the expense of the many?"<p>

<a name="34"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> And the many are the neighbors. In a national sense the many, the neighbors, are the people of the United States as a whole.<p>

<a name="35"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Nationally, we must think of them as a whole and not just by sections or by States.<p>

<a name="36"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> We cannot give special consideration to the people of the North if, in so doing, it will not result in good to the people of the South or the West.<p>

<a name="37"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> We cannot give special privileges to those who farm one particular crop if the giving makes things more difficult for those who farm some other crop.<p>

<a name="38"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> We cannot single out one industry at the expense of others.<p>

<a name="39"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> The national Government must, of course, think in national terms, but your responsibility, your interest in national Government ought not to stop there. The greater part of government, as it affects your daily lives and mine, is your local government.<p>

<a name="40"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> The opportunity in this field of local government for improvement, for a betterment that will be felt in your lives, is just as great as it is in Washington.<p>

<a name="41"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> When I was Governor of the State for four years I used to do a good deal of talking about local government, and just as long as I live, whether I am in Washington or Dutchess County, I am afraid I shall not be able to get over the habit.<p>

<a name="42"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I used to tell people that we have in this State more than 13,000 local units of government. You were all interested; but I did not notice that you did anything about it.<p>

<a name="43"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I used to tell people when I was Governor about the fact that there were over 950 highway departments in the State of New York. You were interested, but I did not notice that you did much about it.<p>

<a name="44"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> I talked to you about the six or eight different layers of government that you lived under, Federal, State, county and town, electric-light district, sewer district and fire-department district, etc. - even sidewalk district and I don't know how many other kinds of districts - and about how you were paying taxes in all of them.<p>

<a name="45"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> But we have not done much yet along that line. We have not done much to reorganize in our local government what you and I know to be an outworn system built up in the days of the oxcart and unchanged in the days of the automobile.<p>

<a name="46"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Some day - because I have always been an optimist, I believe it will occur during our lifetime - some day the people of the State of New York and the county of Dutchess will do something about it.<p>

<a name="47"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> But I tell you that nothing will be done about it unless you make your representatives - your representatives on town boards and county boards and in the State Legislature - do something about it. And if they will not do it, substitute other representatives for them.<p>

<a name="48"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> When I say that, I am not talking Democratic politics, I am talking straight Dutchess County Americanism.<p>

<a name="49"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> May I add that both of the old parties in the county and in the State have been very largely to blame for not giving you people any action? I think you can make them take action - both parties.<p>

<a name="50"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> That all ties in with the old theme of good neighbors. If we have in our Government things that do not work out well for the neighbors, things that redound to the advantage of just a few people who run the Government and redound to the harm of the  voters who do not run the Government except by going to the polls  on election day, the only improvement that we can make must be an  improvement that will help the neighbors. It all ties in together, and I  believe that the people of this country have been taking more  interest in the problems of their own Government, because it is  theirs, than ever before in history.<p>

<a name="51"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> More men and more women are taking an individual, a personal,  interest in all the problems - the social relations and economic and  political problems - than ever before in the history of the Nation, and  I hope that that interest will be extended to the problems of the local  government as well.<p>

<a name="52"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> It seems to me very fitting that I should emphasize to you, my  neighbors, neighbors of my own home county, this thought- that  what is good for my neighbors is good for me, too.<p>

<a name="53"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> It is very delightful to be able to establish the Summer White  House in one's own home, without having to go to a strange house.<p>

<a name="54"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> It is very delightful to have that home within easy striking  distance of Washington. It is very delightful to be able to come there  any time that the Administration and the Congress allow me to, and  find my mother holding the fort.<p>

<a name="55"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> It is not only very delightful and a great relaxation to come to a  party like this, but it does, frankly, help to restore one's sense of  perspective. And when people get near-sighted by being too close to  the Government job day in and day out, their efficiency and value as  public servants begin to falter.<p>

<a name="56"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Just before I came in here the President of the Dutchess County  Society gave me a very beautiful N.R.A. emblem to put on my  coat.<p>

<a name="57"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> The only difficulty about my wearing it is that it is not quite  honest, because I am afraid that I cannot allow the good people that  work for me in the White House to abide by any N.R.A. code.<p>

<a name="58"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Our working day is just as long as it has to be. Sometimes it  starts pretty early in the morning and very often it goes right straight through until the small hours of the next morning. That is  one exception to the N.R.A. that I have to approve.<p>

<a name="59"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Outside of that there is a unity in this country which I have not  seen and you have not seen since April, 1917, by which the  American people are getting together behind the spirit of the  N.R.A. and deciding in every community, in every State, that  they are going to live by these principles, and that through its  operation and through the operation of other great agencies of the  Government which we have started, we are going to bring this  country back to better times.<p>

<a name="60"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> So, my friends, with my family I am grateful to have this  opportunity of seeing you - all my neighbors. Bless you all.  <p>
