<I>To the Congress:</I> <p>



<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a>    At the same time  that you  and I are joining in  emergency action  to bring order to  our banks, and to  make our regular  Federal  expenditures  balance	our  income, I deem it of  equal importance  to take other and  simultaneous steps  without waiting for a later meeting of the Congress. One of these is of definite, constructive importance to our economic recovery.<p>



<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> It relates to agriculture and seeks to increase the purchasing power of  our farmers and the consumption of articles manufactured in our industrial  communities, and at the same time greatly to relieve the pressure of farm  mortgages and to increase the asset value of farm loans made by our  banking institutions.<p>



<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Deep study and the joint counsel of many points of view have  produced a measure which offers great promise of good results. I tell you  frankly that it is a new and untrod path, but I tell you with equal frankness  that an unprecedented condition calls for the trial of new means to rescue  agriculture. If a fair administrative trial of it is made and it does not produce  the hoped-for results I shall be the first to acknowledge it and advise you.<p>



<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> The proposed legislation is necessary now for the simple reason that  the spring crops will soon be planted and if we wait for another month or  six weeks the effect on the prices of this year's crops will be wholly lost.<p>



<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></font></a> Furthermore, by action at this time the United States will be in a better  position to discuss problems affecting world crop surpluses at the  proposed World Economic Conference.<p>
