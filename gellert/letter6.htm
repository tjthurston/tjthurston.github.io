I am writing in support of saving the Seward Park Housing murals. I hope that your hard work pays off and that the owners of the building will realize the ramifications of their actions. I am working on a research paper for an art history class on New York at Smith&#151;my topic is the demolition of the old Penn Station, a tragedy which I doubt the city has truly overcome. An event which I know many architects at Columbia worked hard to stop, so I am glad to see the trend continue with the Seward murals. <P>

Thanks and good luck<P>
