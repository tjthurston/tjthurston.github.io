To Whom It May Concern,<p>

I am writing to add my voice to those protesting the proposed destruction of the Hugo Gellert murals at the Seward Park housing development. These murals are an important part of our cultural heritage. Having lived in New York for many years, I feel deeply that the loss of these murals would mean a loss of a piece of myself, of my own history. Given New York's history as center of artistic and intellectual activity--activity that took place not only under the auspices of elite museums and foundations, but also under those of the organizations and institutions of working people, of struggling neighborhood people, such as the International Ladies Garment Workers Union--the destruction of the murals would help undermine what makes New York such a special city.<P>
