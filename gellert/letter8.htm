To whom it may concern:<P>

Hugo Gellert is among America's genuine treasures. As a youth I was inspired by his cartoons of working people. Later I came to appreciate his murals as one of the few representations of ordinary people, albeit in a heroic mode. The idea that his murals at Seward Park projects should be removed and desecrated is a scandal and would be a rebuke to the people of the area as well as the great popular traditions of the lower east side to which my father and his family migrated at the turn of the century. I urge all of us to resist this proposal.<P>
