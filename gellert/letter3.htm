Thank you for the article "Co-op Murals Inspire Culture Clash" (Feb. 8). I understand that the murals need conservation, but the co-op has no excuse for destroying them. They are irreplaceable. Hugo Gellert, whom I had the pleasure of knowing, cannot come back to life and we cannot go back to 1959.<P>

Perhaps if the residents understood that Hugo was one of the best graphic artists in the period between the World Wars, they would recognize the value of what they have. He was a hard-working and most idealistic artist, one who always sought to embody democratic ideals in his work. He believed that those ideals couldn't go out of date, and I hope the residents can find it in their hearts to agree.<P>
