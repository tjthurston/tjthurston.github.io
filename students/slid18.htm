<p><a name="1"><li></a> I can rather definitely date my interest in politics and social reform to the accidental reading of "Looking Backward" when I was some twelve years old, because I could find no other books to read. It was no accident, however, that it made the profound impression upon me that it did. I was born, in 1915 in Philadelphia, into a fairly typical radical Russian Jewish Family. Altho my parents accept no particular program, their opinions are definitely radical. They themselves avoided discussing political questions with me, because they did not want to influence my ideas, but I could hardly avoid some contamination with social consciousness from their discussions with my relatives and from my unhindered browsing in the family bookcase.

<p><a name="2"><li></a> When I found that mother could not explain, in a way I considered adequate, why Bellamy's beautiful system was not adopted, I turned to reading and lectures for an answer. I religiously attended the lecture series at the Labor Institute, becoming acquainted with socialist thought and gaining my first knowledge of the labor movement. My naive faith in the logic of social systems disappeared soon, but my belief in the necessity for change was intensified.

<p><a name="3"><li></a> I had already acquired the ability to at least hold my own on the unpopular side of arguments by my lone defense of atheism. As my interest in religion declined, and that in social problems increased, I turned from defending atheism to discussing socialism. Fortunately my teachers encouraged me in my attitude. I never had to unlearn traditional history and economics. I brought my questions to classroom discussions, and received answers which convinced me that whatever might be the faults of proposed changes, society as it existed was totally rotten. I wrote papers on the profit system end won debates on the economic causes of America's entrance into the World. War. From the time I campaigned for Thomas in the school elections of 1928 I was known as the school Socialist. I had not yet accepted Socialism, as distinguished from socialism; in fact, I rather prided myself on my 'independence.' But the time I had answered the objections of the solid Republican class, however, I had convinced myself if no one else, of the essential rightness of the Socialist program. It was four years before I joined the Y.P.S.L. merely because there was no circle near enough to my house for me to join. I took an active part once I had joined, becoming City Secretary of the Philadelphia League before leaving for college. 

<p><a name="4"><li></a> Antioch had neither a YPSL or LID. I was active in the "Thomas for President Club", and was rewarded by an honorary membership in the local Socialist Party, entering into full dues-paying privileges on my eighteenth birthday. A group of us tried to organize an L.I.D. but it failed before the end of the year. An YPSL was successfully organized the following year, and an L.I.D. the year just past. I have maintained membership in all three organizations. My activities were too numerous to go into detail about, ranging from sneaking out of the dorm at midnight to feed coffee to strikers to becoming Student director of the Ohio Federation of the Y.P.S.L. My experience with Party and YPSL work as such has been fairly extensive. I have had practically no contact with trade union work and only slight acquaintance with unemployed league work. I have done no street- corner speaking and no picketing. My major in college is a combination of social science and economics, I don't know of any particular talents. I was captain of my high school debating team, but have done no public speaking for this last three years and have regained my original stage fright. Having been editor of my high-school paper and having won a scholarship thru an essay contest, I think I have some ability to get my ideas across in writing. I have had no industrial experience beyond some fifteen weeks in a press employing eight people besides myself. My interest in socialists is obviously inspired by intellectual and emotional decision rather then by actual proletarian experience. I hold no illusions, however, as to my actual class position, and have committed myself definitely, in my own mind, to the place where I can be most effective in revolutionary work. I have not yet found that place, which I think is all the reason necessary to explain why I am here.
