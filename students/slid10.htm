<p><a name="1"><li></a> Born of respectable middle-class parents in Dayton, Ohio on April 28, 1915, I went through school with an all A average and graduated from Steele High School in Dayton with a 96 average.

<p><a name="2"><li></a> 1928 I was very much interested in the campaign of Hon. Alfred E. Smith and although but twelve years old tried to convert everyone to his cause. Neither Mr. Smith's personality nor policies were particularly important to me; I was interested in him because I imagined him a victim of oppression.

<p><a name="3"><li></a> During my senior year in high school I was editor of the high school paper and in that capacity was engaged in a fight with the Dayton Board of Education to keep in office the principal who was removed without cause. Took an active part in the fight, led a delegation of students to see the Governor of Ohio, was threatened with dismissal from office, threatened with cancellation of academic credits but finally escaped unscathed although the gentleman was not reinstated. Five of the seven members of the Board of Education were defeated the following election as a result of our fight which was the light which exploded the powder keg full of grievances.

<p><a name="4"><li></a> Entered the University of Cincinnati and have maintained a Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standard. A member of the Debate Team, president of the L.I.D. president of the International Relations Club, member of the Y.M.C.A. cabinet, proctor of Memorial Dormitory, and was recently elected Editor of the Cincinnati Bearcat. 

<p><a name="5"><li></a> I am a radical&#151;a term which I frankly do not like because it is as meaningless as all general statements&#151;in large part because of study and analysis and in smaller part because of a desire to aid the underdog.

<p><a name="6"><li></a> My family is in large part reactionary and has a place of social standing in the community which I am constantly impairing. They have been what might be conceived of as wealthy; they are active in "charity work"; some of the family are big Democratic and Republican grafters (relatively speaking); some of the family are professional patriots; and the family is split between those who knowingly tolerate radicals and those who despise them.
