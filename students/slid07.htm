<p><a name="1"><li></a> <p>I was born on March 22, 1917. My mother and father were both of German parentage. My mother's parents had been expelled from Germany because of affiliations with the Socialists, my fathers parents were indirectly forced out of the East for Socialistic tendencies. Father died when I was six years old, at the time we were living on the Pacific Coast, in the city of Warrenton, Oregon, a salmon fishing village. My Mother and I moved immediately to Salem, Ore where her parents were located. When I was 10 years old I went to work on fishing boats on the Columbia River. At twelve I entered "deep water fishing" in the Pacific Ocean. I worked on the boats in the summer, and attended the Salem, Ore. schools in the winter. The spring of the year I was 10 or ll, I was working in a Loganberry patch, where M.M. Sweetland was the boss. At this time I was a "parlor pink" and a religious radical, I should more properly say anti-religious radical. During this summer, I was exposed to the Doctrine of Socialism by Monroe, although not extensively till some years later. As to when I became a Socialist I have no idea, I was reared on the doctrine of a Socialist Commonwealth as the only solution of the muddle of present day economic conditions. </p>

<p><a name="2"><li></a> <p>In the last three years I have tried my hand, in a very small manner, at organizing. I have tried to organize the Lower Columbia and Pacific fishers Federation, a very loosely organized and democratic organization of about 15% of the fishermen of Claptrop County, Ore. I had little or no success. All of the men own their own boats. The only success that I may have had was to persuade all the fishermen of certain companies to sell their salmon to Co-op canneries.</p>

<p><a name="3"><li></a> <p>I also tried to establish an L.I.D. organization in Salem High School, but was completely blocked by the faculty, with hearty support, I believe by the American Legion. However, I was later elected an Honorary of the Am. Legion Post in Salem, for work done among their scout troop. I might add that I have 32 potential members of the L.I.D. in that troop, unbeknownst to the members of aforementioned Legionnaires.</p>

<p><a name="4"><li></a> <p>I have also tried to lay a ground work in logging camps with very indifferent success, although I think that this is one of the most fertile fields for organizers. A large percent of the loggers are, however, joining the Communist party.</p>

<p><a name="5"><li></a> <p>Oregon has little or no radical activity, and in the past three years I have tried to promote such activity, nearly all my attempts ending in failure, that is one reason I am so grateful to attend the Summer School. I hope that I shall learn enough here to enable me to return to Oregon and carry on some really constructive work.</p>
