<FONT size=3 face="Arial" color="darkred"><b>Overview:</b></FONT><p>

<dl><dd>Student movements of the 1930s represent the first mass student movement in America.  The student activists involved in these movements mobilized high school and college students in anti-war strikes.  With the Great Depression as the local and national backdrop, the student movements initiated much needed reform to alleviate the economic hardship of the youth.  They strongly supported the federal government providing students with financial aid to subsidize the cost of education and providing jobs.  They sought to preserve academic freedom, racial equality and labor rights.</dd></dl>  <BR clear=all>



<FONT size=3 face="Arial" color="darkred"><b>Life as a student in the 1930s:</b></FONT><p>
<dl><dd>Being a college student during the 1930s was tough.  Because of the Great Depression, student loans were few and many parents could no longer help to support their children who were students.  In fact, fewer students attended college and universities than in the economic boom decade of the 1920s.  Observing the massive unemployment surrounding them, many college students even wondered if their diplomas would be worthless.<P>

As the wrath of the Great Depression persisted, the nation was on the verge of bankruptcy.  The national income dwindled from $85 billion to $39 billion within four years, and had taken a toll on the quality of life of the nation's citizens.  To illustrate, it was reported that one in four workers in Indiana lost his or her job.  In Chicago, where women made up a sizable number of the workforce, earnings dropped to between twenty-five and ten cents an hour!  Two thousand New Yorkers from the Bowery section joined bread lines for food.  Additionally, close to ten million savings accounts were lost in this difficult period, resulting in the failings of at least eighty-five thousand businesses around the nation.  Worst of all, the 14 million newly unemployed were not entitled to any compensation, because of the dire circumstances of the government at that time.<P>

It was because of these circumstances that colleges throughout the nation, in response to the Depression, hiked their tuition fees for students.  As a result of this sudden fee increment that the student movement, namely the <A HREF="lesson0.htm#ft1">National Student League</A> (NSL) in New York's city colleges, gained momentum as it pushed not only to end additional student fees, but also to provide federal support for students with the <A HREF="lesson0.htm#ft2">American Youth Act</A>.  The Depression also heightened students' awareness of the economic disparities among the citizens of the nation, where parents of poor students were unable to finance their children's education.  The "middle-class guilt," by most accounts, reinforced why many students joined the American Student Union (ASU).</dd></dl><P>


<FONT size=3 face="Arial" color="darkred"><b>What were the student movements about?</b></FONT><p>
<dl><dd>Things had changed since the boom times of the 1920s.  During this decade, the country enjoyed an economic prosperity, which was reflected in the student populations.  In the 1930s, however, the bleak economic circumstances of America, also hit the students.  Many of the students were depressed about their future prospects, and found a convincing critique in the leftist student movements.  These movements criticized the capitalist system, which provided no safety net for the millions of Americans who were impoverished.  Many college students tried to understand the collapse of America's economy and turned to organizations like the ASU.  Students in the 1930s were ready to pay attention to these organizations.<P>  

Events taking place in the international arena, also caused many students to agree with the politics of student movements.  Many high school and college students participated in peaceful anti-war protests, organized by the student ASU.  These students read daily reports concerning the growing aggression of tyrants like Adolph Hitler.  As these students watched his and other's aggressions mount, they feared another world war.  These socialist students were very suspicious about America's past involvement in the Great War (World War I), and they felt that instead of preserving democracy, war serves the interests of the capitalist elite.<P>

After watching their peers at Oxford University in Great Britian protest against war in 1933, American student movements adopted the Oxford Pledge and "refused to support the government of the United States in any war it might undertake."  In April of 1934, the student movements initiated their first national, one-hour strikes.  Symbolically, student leaders chose to hold the strike on the anniversary of America's entry into World War I.  Between 1936 and 1939, these movements organized 500,000 college and high school students for anti-war strikes.</dd></dl><P>


<FONT size=3 face="Arial" color="darkred"><b>Promoting Egalitarianism:</b></FONT><p>
<dl><dd>The student movements believed that the egalitarianism they sought in society should be reflected in their own organizations.  ASU members sought for racial equality on their school's campuses as they continued to urge college administrators to change their policy of excluding the admittance of African American students.  Even those African American students who attended "white colleges" were not immune to discrimination, as they were barred from using facilities used by whites.  Black students were forced to live several miles off campus and because they were barred from campus dining, they had to carry their own food to school.  Jim Crow, alas, was everywhere.  It was from this background that several ASU leaders began a major recruitment drive to enlist African American students across the country, in effort to form a unified front in tackling economic and social issues.<P>

Also important to student activists was the issue of gender equality.  Unlike other student organizations which discriminated against female participants, the ASU enabled women to obtain leadership positions within the movement.  When the ASU was formed in 1935, women leaders filled two of the six national positions.  It was this respect for women and issues of gender equality which also motivated the student's anti-war argument.  As they watched the events unfold in Germany, many student activists were alarmed by Hitler's policy towards women as he relegated them to the female domain of home and children.  Many articles in the student movement's publications warned against this reactionary policy.  "Feminists struggled for a century and a half to reach what little there is today of feminine emancipation... In sixteen months German fascism has been able to wipe out the work..."</dd></dl><P>

<FONT size=3 face="Arial" color="darkred"><b>You be the historical detective:</b></FONT><p>
<dl><dd>Hopefully, this overview has provided you with an understanding of student movements during the 1930s.  It is now time for you to play the role of the historical detective and to engage in the lives of the student activists.  The historical search is the most rewarding when you get to know the characters of a period.  We invite you to meet the activists by reading their personal stories and engaging in activities about these stories. </dd></dl><P>
