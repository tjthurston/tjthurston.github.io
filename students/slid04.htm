<p><a name="1"><li></a> I was born Feb. 5, 1915 Detroit where I live all of my life. Both of my parents immigrated from Jugo-Slavia with largely the same objects in mind as motivated most Europeans to cross the ocean, namely liberty and prosperity. Like most idealists with materialistic dreams, they were disappointed, although my father later achieved a tolerable economic status. My father's experience with the capitalistic system, first as a worker with little status and later as an executive and engineer, together with a revolutionary spirit he acquired in the student terrorist organizations in Europe made him a socialist. Like most wives my mother soon was persuaded to the same belief.

<p><a name="2"><li></a> To be perfectly honest, I give the same reason for being a Socialist as every good Republican gives for being a bonehead; my father and mother are Socialists. Ever since I was a child I was almost religiously indoctrinated with Socialism and Atheism. I can honestly say that the biggest factor in my life as well as that of my two brothers was this concept so full of hope and promise, socialism.

<p><a name="3"><li></a> Since I was the most intellectually inclined in the family I took an extremely precocious interest in Socialism. As I hinted before Socialism was something I accepted religiously, without analysis; and therefore, all my thinking was in the form of a priori rationalization. Debs and Marx were more to me than great leaders, they were demi gods whom I loved and revered and after whose lives I wanted to pattern my own.

<p><a name="4"><li></a> Fortunately for my critical faculties I went through a period of adolescent revolt, but instead of revolting against the old I revolted against the new. I became completely skeptical about Socialism in the same manner as one brought up in a religious environment becomes skeptical about God. It was then that I learned to view Socialism and economics critically.

<p><a name="5"><li></a> After some reading and observation I was re-converted to cause of Socialism. What type of Socialism and what tactics we should employ in its achievement still are insoluble problems. As a result I oscillated between Bolshevism and anarchism, right wingism and left wingism. Usually I was able to find intellectual bedfellows in all of these camps. 

<p><a name="6"><li></a> Throughout my later high school and college career I wasn't much more than a parlor red, even though I maintained loose connections with the radical movement. I played the role of an opportunist, and engaged activities that would enhance my social prestige, such as debating, dramatics, and respectable clubs. I have always desired to become a part of the radical movement but the other activities were too enticing.

<p><a name="7"><li></a> It was in the last semester that I really identified myself with the radical movement, largely because of more or less coincidental connections with the anti-war strike. During the last few months all of my time and energy was spent in radical organizations. I worked with the Michigan Youth Congress, the Y.P.S.L., and several school radical groups. As a consequence I became elected chairman of the Wayne University Anti-War Committee. When I wasn't working with the radical groups I attempted to do some subversive work in the conservative groups such as the International Relations Club.

<p><a name="8"><li></a> I was sent to S.L.I.D. by the Detroit Chapter of L.I.D., for the purpose of organizing a student chapter at Wayne U. I also was accepted as a teacher for the Workers Educational Bureau sponsored by the A.F. of L. and financed by the F.E.R.A. From now on I intend to make labor organization work my life career.
