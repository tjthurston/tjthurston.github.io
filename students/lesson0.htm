<dd>The National Student League (NSL) and the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID) were both student organizations that grew in the 1930s. The NSL was founded in 1931 and deeply valued active protest instead of sitting around and debating the problems that the students faced. The SLID merged with the NSL in 1935 to form the American Student Union (ASU). This merge made the ASU the largest student activist organization in America's history with an estimated membership of 20,000 students. For examples of individual student experiences in the ASU, see the student autobiographies.<P>

Why do you think so many students participated in student movements during the 1930s? After all, during the 1920s only 2,000 of 2 million students were affiliated with these organizations.

<dd>The Depression's dramatic impact on youth was underscored on February 1937, when "3,000 young demonstrators marched on the White House." These young people were students as well as youth participants from organizations around the country. Together, these young people formed the American Youth Congress which included students as well as members from:  <P><ul><li> Nat'l Student Federation <li> YWCA <li> Nat'l Intercollegiate <li> Christian Council <li> Nat'l Council of Methodist Youth  <li> Youth Committee Against War  <li> Young People's Socialist League <li> Young Communist League <li> Southern Negro Youth Congress <li> Chinese Student League <li> Young Judaea <li> American Student Union <li> Southern Tenant Farmers Union <li> American Jewish Congress <li> NAACP  <li> United Auto Workers  <li> United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers</ul><P>

(Do you belong to any of these organizations??)<P>



They cried, "Scholarships, not battleships" and "We never had jobs." Together with the ASU, this Youth Congress demanded access to jobs and education and well as federal aids for victims of the Depression. Their primary aim was to achieve an egalitarian and equal society. Thanks in part to the persistent effort of the student and youth activists, and to the assistance of Eleanor Roosevelt, the Roosevelt administration passed the National Youth Act, under the New Deal program, and thus was the beginning of Federal Financial Aid. <P>

Is financial aid for students still an important issue? Why do you think so? </dt><P>

<dd>The New Deal ushered in a new chapter in the relationship between the Youth Congress and the ASU as they formed an alliance in their fight for equal rights for all people. The two groups also softened their position on capitalism, an economic system once viewed by some ASU and other political movements as the primary cause of for the nation's unequal economic distributions. It was in the wake of the post New Deal ideals, that Eleanor Roosevelt became involved with the ASU. Her contribution to youth and the student movements has been extensively documented in Robert Cohen's book, <I>When the Old Left was Young</I>.<P>

Her involvement with the Youth Congress also held important implications for African Americans. Mirroring the egalitarian ideals of these student movements, Eleanor Roosevelt was able to convince politicians (some of whom were unabashedly racist) for the need for a more systematic protection for African Americans during this Jim Crow era. This point of view was also reflected in the Youth Congress' charter which was conceived in 1935, as evident in the following statement:<P>

<dl><dd>"In song and legend America has been exalted as a land of the free, a haven for the oppressed. Yet on every hand we see this freedom limited or destroyed... The Negro is subjected to constant abuse, discrimination and lynching..."</dd></dl><P>

In what other ways was Eleanor Roosevelt an advocate for youth? (Hint: check out the Dear Mrs. Roosevelt letters.)

<dt><FONT size=3 face="Arial" color="darkred"><b><A name="ft7">Jim Crow</A>:</b></font><P>

<dd>The term Jim Crow refers to the set of social and legal laws that forced the segregation between African American and white people. Some examples of Jim Crow are separate water fountains, bathrooms and schools. </dt><P>

<dd>Rembert Stokes, an African American student from Wilberforce College in Dayton, Ohio, joined the ASU movement after being recruited by white student activists.  Rembert Stoke's letter highlights some of the social transformations taking place during the 1930s.  He acknowledges the collaborative efforts between the ASU and other black students movements in the fight for racial equality which was a genuine value of the ASU to connect on a human level with black students, even at the expense of risking their own educational endeavor and, occasionally, their lives. </dt> <P>



<dt><FONT size=3 face="Arial" color="darkred"><b><A name="ft9">Women leaders</A>:</b></font><P> 

<dd>Molly Yard was one of the active student leaders in the ASU. She remembers the positive stance of the ASU, in promoting women to leadership positions: "...when the question came up as to who was going to become chair of the Student Union, it turned out that both Joe and I decided that each one of us should have the role. I said to Joe... "you know, Joe, that in this world of ours, everyone will expect you to become the chair because you are a man. That's the way society is. But I think I should become the chair. That makes some kind of a statement which I think is important." And Joe agreed. So I did become chair of the Student Union."</dt>
