This new technology paved the way for people to take pictures of themselves 
and of family.  I believe that families benefited off of this and young 
couples who wanted to take their pictures.
I believe that people had a need for pictures to capture their past for 
future generations, and that's where this technology comes in.

The difference in Harlem from the early 1900's and late 1900's<P>

     During the lesson, we saw pictures of Harlem with farmland.  This was 
before technology was a major part of the North.  In the picture titled 
above, I saw the construction of buildings in Harlem.  If you compare these 
two pictures, it proves the advances of technology.  There weren't any 
lights on the streets, not many paved roads, nor bridges.  It's pretty 
difficult for me to imagine Harlem, in my words, naked. My hometown without 
125 St!  I cannot imagine it.  Now, Harlem is still in the process of 
advancement of technology.  More homes have computers and more schools have 
computers.  Here we can see technology as a benefactor for individuals.

During the great depression, FDR had jobless people work, like building
railroads, bridges.. etc.. How were these workers paid? The country itself
didn't have any money....<P>

<B>Response:</B> A portion of the federal budget was used to pay people to participate on work projects, such as those done by the Works Progress Administration. Congress often had big fights about how much money should go to fund the WPA. With unemployment being so high (as much as 12 million people were out of work at one time) cities and private charities could not provide for impoverished people. The Roosevelt administration believed it was better for people and for the country to pay people to work rather than just giving the an unemployment check. There is a <A HREF="http://newdeal.feri.org/misc/faq/index.htm" target="docs">WPA Handbook</A> online that provides a quick description of this.

At first this picture may look like a typical role reverse. The 
male looks like he is doing the wife duties....but you see all of FDR new 
programs for the New Deal. You see creating more and more new deals.

   Technology affected all aspects of American life. The television allowed 
people to have greater aspirations in everything they did. This "ad" tells 
the consumer that he/she no longer has to settle for only observing local 
sporting events in the neighborhood, but they can see the best of the best 
on a national level and hope to one day be there themselves.<P>

This illustrates mildly the effects of the refrigerator on communities
rather than individuals. A question that I have. Do you feel that the
widespread technological advancements that were and still are being
made are being made out of necessity or out of appreciation for it? I
question the impact of some of it and wonder if its done just to have
something to brag about.

I believe the picture envisioned what ideas FDR have for the 
development for America as too the technological side. In his mind he, FDR, 
has a map or a blue print as to what his mind sees America.

To  professor  Thurston :<P>

   Due  to  the  fact  that  I  am  a  resident  of  Queens , and  live  but 
  a  few  minutes  from  this  bridge , it's  existence  plays  a  
convenient  role  to  the  many  other  residents  of  the  Rockaways . 
Without  this  bridge , to  get  to  BKLYN  or Manhattan  for  that  matter, we  would  have  to  go  through  Long  Island
or  Cross bay , so  many  people are in  favour  and  loyal  to  the  bridge. Therefore , as  the  use  of  this  bridge  becomes  all  the  more  
widespread , first  and  foremost  by  my  family , I  can  make  the  
statement  that  the  bridge  signifies  two  aspects  to  people  of  which 
  are  convience  and  the  expansion  of  technology  also  represented  
through  the  new  E-Z  pass device that  has  implemented  on  our  City's  
transportation  system .

To the Professor,<P>
I chose the topic of railroads. One reason I chose it because I really
hate taking the train. They are too slow and never on time. The address
of the site I looked at was The Removal of the 4th Avenue Street
Car. Even though trains have helped us, in what way can we make them better?

1. the document is saying that you need it to engage in the many activities
that consume the time of the people in the time frame the advertisement
refers to.<P>
2. I expect that the technology would make time consuming chores easier and
quicker to complete. In essence enriching peoples lives by allowing them
more time to do what they view as enjoyable. It can only make life better.<P>
3. The advertisements says that technology is important in the imagination
of the masses. It says that people imagine a world of convenience that makes
everything easier so they can enjoy their leisure. <P>

<!-- Student -->
Tashika Beswick
<!-- Response --><p>

While viewing this picture I was infatuated by the fact of how women were
able to create dolls to satisfy the children's need. What influence did this
creation bring to children in the 1930's and today. Also were the dolls
that were created by the WPA reflect the lifestyle of the women in the 1930?
Do you think that the creation of the doll was a major technology during the
Great Depression? I also have another question pertaining to  what you
mentioned in your earlier lecture.  Do you think that it was easier for
people to use short wave radios to send a message to others rather than
computers?  Explain fully. I took the time to browse through your web page
and I found something very interesting. The <A HREF="http://newdeal.feri.org/eleanor/index.htm" target="docs">Dear Mrs. Roosevelt</A> letters
really upset me.  In almost all of those request for clothes, so that they
were able to go to school she denied there request even for old clothes of
her and then had the decency to apologize for not being able to provide them
with what they needed in order to get an education. How did she think that
the American society would be able to prosper if she wasn't going to comply
to the need of the poor. <P>

<B>The disadvantage in technology today</B><P>

I have been thinking, and i have noticed that back in the years, people used
to live longer then people do now.. i guess its because since technology is
advancing, people become more lazy, when long ago, people had to get up, do
the things the hard way, and that work made them live longer.. Like today
television came about, and many people just sit in front of that colour box
and all you see is that their stomach swells and their brain power is just
shut down, after years if they are asked to think, they find it hard..
Farmers, used to walk miles and spend hours on the field harvesting and
planting, now farmers just hop onto the machine and plow , or harvest.. I
think, i may be wrong but i think that people were healthier before than
today... Technology in medicine is great, I just wanted to know for sure
that one of the reasons that people lived longer before was because they did
things the hard way, and today, people become sick faster then they did
before, people don't live till the age of 83 at the most... is this true??
