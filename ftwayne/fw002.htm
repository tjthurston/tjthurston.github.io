<a name="1"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>New WPA regulations concerning sanitary sewer projects in Indiana are not likely to affect Fort Wayne WPA officials said here yesterday.<p>

<a name="2"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>New regulations state that project applications for the construction, reconstruction, repair or extension of sewers dumping into lakes or streams will not be approved unless evidence is shown that the sewage is treated in a disposal plant, or that a general plan has been submitted for the establishment of a disposal plant, and evidence presented that the proposed work fits into the plan.<p>

<a name="3"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>It is expected that the present $450,000 sanitary sewer project, now operating in three sections of the city, will be completed early this winter. But with Fort Wayne mandated by the state to have a sewage disposal plant be January 1, 1939, and since plans have already been drawn for a plant with the hope of a FWA grant, any sewers to be built under a new project, could be made in link up with the disposal plant, it was said.<p>

<a name="4"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Under the conditions, WPA officials anticipate little difficulty in having new sewer projects for the city approved.<p>
