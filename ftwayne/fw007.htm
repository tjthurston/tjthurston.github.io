Quackenbush, supervisor for this district, which includes the counties of Adams, Blackford, and Wells, were the principal speakers at a conference of sponsors held at he courthouse in this city. <p>

<a name="2"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Director Woodward stated that the WPA program is generally intended to end on June 30, but that projects were being approved of a nature that could not be completed then. Whether WPA will continue long after June 30, he stated, will depend on whether congress makes further appropriations for this work.<p>

<a name="3"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Some of the sponsors asked questions concerning new sewer projects, and Director Woodward informed them that the government has made a ruling that no sewer projects will be approved unless the cities have a sewage disposal plant or have started definite  plans for the construction of one.<p>

<a name="4"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Many other problems in connection with WPA projects were discussed at the meeting. When the sidewalk and curb repair project is halted in this city by cold weather, Mayor Franklin Buckner informed the WPA officials that the city could continue a street and alley repair project of a nature that could be done in cold weather.<p>
