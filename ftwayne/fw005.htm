<font size=5>WPA Reduction Is Continued</font></center><p>
<I>Oct. 5, 1937</I><p>

<a name="1"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Reduction of WPA employment in the Fort Wayne district of 10 counties has continued, and present figures show a decrease of more than 600 since July 15. Forrest M. Woodward, district director, announced yesterday.<p>

<a name="2"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>At the present time 5,469 WPA workers are employed in the district as compared to 5,806 on September 1, and 6, 487 on July 15.<p>

<a name="3"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>The reduction in Allen county has depicted the WPA employment here to 1,546 at the present time from 1,570 on September 1, and 1,713 in July, a drop of 169 since July.<p>

<a name="4"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>The greatest per cent of loss has been through private industry, Mr. Woodward said. While a number of persons have been taken on the program, the reduction greatly offsets the additional workers.<p>
