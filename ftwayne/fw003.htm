<a name="1"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>The enthusiastic warm reception accorded President Roosevelt by the people of the west, from the state of Iowa to the state of Washington, would today be duplicated in any section through which the chief executive should chance to past.<p>

<a name="2"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Its warmth would be found both in the cities and on the farms, in towns and in hamlets that amount to no more than widenings in the road. And nowhere would it be more real than in the great agricultural community of the nation.<p>

<a name="3"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>By using the word "community" in this sense, we do not imply that there is any place where large numbers of farmers live together as closely as city folk are forced to live.<p>

<a name="4"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Rather, by "community" we mean "farmers as a whole"--farmers in north and south and east and west, farmers who definitely enjoy a community of interest no matter where they happen to reside.<p>

<a name="5"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>For the American farmer is well aware that the agricultural program of Franklin D. Roosevelt, dating back to the early days of 1933, is the first and only broad-range programs designed to help the farmer which really worked.<p>

<a name="6"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>A minority of city dwellers are now inclined to condemn the A.A.A. Yet every farmer, and every wide-awake city dweller for that matter, knows that the prosperity returned to America when the A.A.A. began to work, then and only then.<p>

<a name="7"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>And without prosperity on the farm, there cannot be conceivably be prosperity on the city streets and in the homes of our urban communities.<p>

<a name="8"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Farmers know this. Farmers appreciate this.<p>

<a name="9"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Since the slaughter of the A.A.A. at the hands of the supreme court, farm experts have been at work devising another policy for the benefit of our rural citizens.<p>

<a name="10"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Such a policy may be put into effect at a special session of the federal congress, to be called in the very near future by the President.<p>

<a name="11"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Or, on the other hand, if it is not put into effect then, it will certainly be put into effect at the regular session of congress.<p>

<a name="12"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>Meanwhile, what did the last regular session do for agriculture? Some narrow Republican partisans say it did too little. Other say it did too much. Here is the record;<p>

<a name="13"><font color=#666666><li></font></a>The Soil Conversation act was extended until 1942. The Agricultural Marketing act was passed, as were the Farm Tenant act, the Perishable Agriculture Commodities act, the Great Plains Drought act, the Farm Credit act, and the Cotton Classification act.<p>
