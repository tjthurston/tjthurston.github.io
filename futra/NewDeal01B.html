<P>The purpose of this lesson plan is to help high school students become
familiar with the FDR, the breadth of the Great Depression, and the short&nbsp;
and long term role of the New Deal programs in American society.&nbsp;
Even today, several New Deal programs are a part of our lives, including
Social Security, Labor Unions (Wagner), agricultural business practices,
and the current welfare state.&nbsp; The activities in this lesson serve
to promote higher order thinking skills, problem solving skills, group
interaction and team work skills, and better writing skills.
