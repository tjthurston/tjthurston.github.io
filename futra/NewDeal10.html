<P><B>Directions:</B> You will want to look through the <A HREF="http://www.wizvax.net/nisk_hs/departments/social/fdr_ html/FDRcartoons/html">FDR
Cartoon Database</A>&nbsp; for cartoons to use.&nbsp; Find at least one
cartoon that supports FDR and at least one that is against the FDRís court
packing.&nbsp; No doubt, it will be easier to find ones against the plan.&nbsp;
Then, make 5-6 copies of the cartoons and the analysis guide and staple
them into packets.&nbsp; Divide your class into groups of 4-5.&nbsp; Give
each group a packet.&nbsp; Allow them about 15 minutes to look over the
cartoons and interpret them.&nbsp; If you want to, and if you find enough
cartoons, have each group analyze their own cartoon and then explain what
they found to the entire class.&nbsp; Make sure, however, that each group
has copies of ALL of the cartoons in their packets. This way, they wonít
get distracted so easily while the other groups are presenting their findings.&nbsp;
Their is a good Cartoon Analysis guide&nbsp; in Social Education in a 1997
issue.&nbsp; I donít know which issue for it was forwarded to me without
the issue information.&nbsp; If you happen to know, please e-mail me with
it and I will add that information to this lesson plan.

<P><B>Cartoon Analysis</B>:
<BR>Identify any symbols:&nbsp; these could be people, places, slogans,
numbers, or symbols.
<BR>Identify any people in the cartoon.&nbsp; Who are they and why are
they important.
<BR>Identify where the cartoon is taking place.&nbsp; Is this significant?
<BR>Identify any words or slogans.&nbsp; What do they mean.
<BR>Identify the artists attitude.&nbsp; Does the artist seem to be making
a positive or negative statement.
<BR>Identify any charactitures.&nbsp; These would include any body/facial
features that might be exaggerated to bring attention for them.&nbsp; Are
they positive or negative?
