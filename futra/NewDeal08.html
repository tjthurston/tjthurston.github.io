<P><B>Directions:</B> Follow the below outline.&nbsp; To add to this activity,
I suggest finding a photo of FDR giving a Fire Side chat. You will want
to make a class set of copies of the fireside chat.

<P><B>Pre-Reading information:</B>
<BR>&nbsp;- Supreme Court feel FDR over step his rights as president
<BR>&nbsp;declare AAA and NRA unconstitutional.
<BR>&nbsp;- FDR not want Court to declare New Deal programs unconstitutional.
<BR>&nbsp;- Fireside chat appeal to public about plan

<P><B>Read document - <A HREF="newdeal09.html">Fireside Chat</A></B>
<BR>&nbsp;- call on a student to read a small section
<BR>&nbsp;- then ask someone else to explain the small section just read
<BR>&nbsp;- repeat until finished

<P><B>Class discuss of document:</B>
<BR>&nbsp;- What was FDRís plan? (Over 70 years old -> new justice = 6,
total of 15&nbsp; justices if plan was implemented)
<BR>&nbsp;- Why did he feel the need for the plan? Supreme Court out of&nbsp;
control, restore balance, protect publics wants and needs)

<P><B>Post-reading information:</B>
<BR>&nbsp; - plan unpopular with public cause Supreme Court is to be separate&nbsp;
from parties and untouchable
<BR>&nbsp;- plan didn't pass, some projects declared unconstitutional.
(AAA, NRA) economy began to fail again

<P><B>Short answer question for homework:</B>
<BR>Take a side and support it with solid arguments.&nbsp; It is 1937 and
you are at a party in Washington D.C.&nbsp; The conversation turns to President
Franklin Roosevelt's Court Packing Plan.&nbsp; Pretend you are either an
aid for President Franklin Roosevelt, who supports the Court Packing Plan,
or a dissenting Justices on the Supreme Court, who has been ruling against
the New Deal programs.&nbsp; Explain to the party guests what your stand
is on the Court Pack Plan and why.
