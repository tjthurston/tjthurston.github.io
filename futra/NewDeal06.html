<P><B>Introductory Information:</B> One of FDRís New Deal programs was
the Workers Progress Administration (WPA).&nbsp; The WPA employed 35 million
unemployed people to build or improve schools, airports and roads.&nbsp;
Within the WPA there were divisions that hired writers, actors, artists,
and musicians to bring the performing arts to people in many U.S. communities.&nbsp;
Another division of the WPA was called the Federal Writersí Project (FWP).&nbsp;
The FWP hired people to interview those people who had been slaves before
the Civil War and to write down the oral histories of what slave life was
like.&nbsp; Many of these former-slaves had experience slavery only as
children and were in their 70s and 80s when the interviews were held.&nbsp;
What resulted from the efforts of the FWP was an invaluable reserve of
primary source information.

<P><B>Directions:</B> Each student will be taking on a role similar to
that of those who worked for the FWP.&nbsp; For the purpose of this writing
assignment, the student will be interviewing a person of their choosing
on any one of a variety of historic events that have occurred between 1930s
and 1980s.&nbsp; The final result of each student effort will be a historic
primary source document, which will be compiled into a collection with
other similar student produced documents to be utilized by future students.&nbsp;
These papers will possibly be set up on a web page or in a book.
<BR>&nbsp;This writing assignment will be completed through several stages
over a 22 day period (number of days may vary depending on when weekends
fall, test dates and other things).&nbsp; Many steps of this assignment
have a point value attached to them.&nbsp; The student is to keep this
handout and record their points on it.

<P><B>Note:</B> The teacher reserves the right to make any necessary changes/adaptions
to the below schedule.
