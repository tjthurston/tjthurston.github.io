<P>Tonight...I am reminded of that evening in March, four years ago, when
I made my first radio report to you.&nbsp; We were then in the midst of
the great banking crisis.&nbsp; Soon after, with the authority of the Congress,
we asked the Nation to turn over all of its privately held gold, dollar
for dollar to the Government of the United States. Todayís recovery proves
how right that policy was.&nbsp; But when, almost two years later, it came
before the Supreme Court, its constitutionality was upheld only by a five-to-four
vote.&nbsp; The change of one vote would have thrown this great Nation
back into hopeless chaos...

<P>In 1933 you and I knew that we must never let our economic system get
completely out of joint again - that we could not afford to take the risk
of another great depression.&nbsp; We also become convinced that the only
way to avoid a repetition of those dark days was to have a government with
the power to prevent and to cure the abuses and the inequalities which
had thrown that system out of joint.&nbsp; We then began [the New Deal]
program of remedying those abuses and inequalities... Today we are only
part-way through that program...National laws are needed to complete that
program

<P>It is the American people themselves who are in the driverís seat.&nbsp;
It is the American people themselves who want the furrow plowed.

<P>In the face of dissenting [anti-New Deal] opinions by the Supreme Court,
there is no basis for the claim made by some members of the Court that
something in the Constitution has compelled them regretfully to thwart
the will of the people [and declare New Deal programs unconstitutional].&nbsp;
In the face of such dissenting opinions, it is perfectly clear, that...the
Court...is reading into the Constitution words and implications which are
not there, and which were never intended to be there.&nbsp; We have, therefore,
reached the point as a Nation where we must take action to save the Constitution
from the Supreme Court and the Court from itself.

<P>What is my proposal?&nbsp; It is simply this: whenever a Judge or Justice
of any Federal Court [including the Supreme Court] has reached the age
of seventy and does not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a
pension, a new member shall be appointed by the President then in office,
with the approval, as required by the Constitution, of the Senate of the
United States...If, for instance, any one of the six Justices of the Supreme
Court now over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the plan,
no additional places would be created...Why the age fixed at seventy? Because
[of the commonly fixed] retirement age of seventy years or younger.

<P>Those opposing this plan have sought to arouse prejudice and fear by
crying that I am seeking to ìpackî the Supreme Court...It is charged that
I wish to place on the bench spineless puppets who would disregard the
law and would decide specific cases as I wish them to be decided.&nbsp;
[To that] I make this answer - that no President fit for his office would
confirm that kind of appointees to the Supreme Court...

<P>Like all Americans, I regret the necessity of this controversy.&nbsp;
But the welfare of the United States, and indeed of the Constitution itself,
is what we all must think about first.&nbsp; Our difficulty with the Court
today rises not from the Court as an institution but from the human beings
within it.&nbsp; But we cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the
personal judgment of a few men who, being fearful of the future, would
deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present...During the past
half century the balance of power between the three great branches of the
Federal Government has been tipped out of balance by the Courts in direct
contradiction of the high purpose of the framers of the Constitution.&nbsp;
It is my purpose to restore that balance.&nbsp; You who know me will accept
my solemn assurance that in a world in which democracy is under attack,
I seek to make American democracy succeed.
