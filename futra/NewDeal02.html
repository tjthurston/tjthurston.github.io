<P><B>The story behind the image:</B>
<BR>Dorothea Lange was working for the Farm Security Administration in
the mid-1930s.&nbsp; Along with her colleagues Russell Lee and Roy Stryker,
she documented the problems of farm tenancy (or occupancy) in images that
would become classic.&nbsp; This photo was taken at a pea-pickerÌs camp
in Nipomo, California. She couldn't find any permanent work and that she
could find was for very little money.&nbsp; Later Lange recalled, ÏI saw
and approached the hungry and desperate mother, as if drawn by a magnet.&nbsp;
I do not remember who I explained by presence or my camera to her, but
I do remember she asked me no questions.&nbsp; I made five exposures, working
closer and closer . . . I did not ask her name or her history.&nbsp; She
told me her age, that she was thirty-two.&nbsp; She said that they had
been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds
that the children killed.&nbsp; She had just sold the tires from her car
to buy food.&nbsp; There she sat in that lean-to tent with her children
huddled around her, and seemed to know that my picture might help her,
and so she helped me.&nbsp; There was a sort of equality about it.Ó Quoted
in Milton MeltzerÌs Dorothea Lange: A PhotographerÌs Life, NY:Farrar Straus
Giroux, 1978.&nbsp; Photograph from the Library of Congress. (Also see
WomenÌs America, Kerber and De Hart)

<P><B>Questions for post-story discussion:</B>
<BR>ÔHow do you now see the woman?
<BR>ÔHow do you feel towards her?
<BR>ÔWould you want to help her if you could?
<BR>ÔWhat would you do to help her?
<BR>ÔWhat do you think Lange meant when she said: ÏThere she sat in that
lean-to tent with her children huddled around her, and seemed to know that
my picture might help her, and so she helped me.&nbsp; There was a sort
of equality about it.Ó
<BR>ÔIf you were running for President of the United States and you wanted
her to vote for you, what would you promise her, what would you do? (Create
jobs, help farmers...)
