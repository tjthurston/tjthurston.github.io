<P><B>Directions:</B> Have the excerpt either on the board, on the overhead,
or as a handout for the students to do at the end of the lesson or the
following day when the students first come to class.&nbsp; In their journals,
have them explore the excerpt below and the posed questions about the REA,
The Year the Lights Came On, and the effect of electricity on the American
people.&nbsp; If you want, you can have your students read the entire book.&nbsp;
It is an enjoyable read for all high school age students.

<P><B>Journal Writing Assignment:</B> Pretend that you were one of the
millions of Americans who got electricity as a result of the efforts of
the REA.&nbsp; How do you feel about this new ìluxuryî?&nbsp; How will
it change your life for the better and for the worse.

<P><B>Questions to consider:</B>&nbsp; What is the author saying about
the affect electricity had on people?&nbsp; Was it all good?&nbsp; Why
does he use the word ìisolationî to describe the way people were living
before they got electricity?

<P><B>Foundation Information:</B> The REA (Rural Electrification Administration)
does not make or transmit electricity.&nbsp; It is a government agency
- one of FDRís New Deal programs - that provides financing programs and
develops standards of cooperatives providing electricity to millions of
Americans.

<TD>ìThe announcement was printed, front page, in The Eden County Garden.&nbsp;
The headline was: NEW POWER LINE TO BE TURNED ON.&nbsp; The REA had completed
its spider webbing and its hookups.&nbsp; On a given date, at a given hour,
the main switch, off somewhere beyond our imaginations, would be pushed,
or pulled, in a ceremony featuring speakers and officials and a ribbon
cutting (there was always a ribbon-cutting), and electricity would leap
along the messenger lines to flood our home...&nbsp;

<P>We are easily deceived.&nbsp; The REA changed our lives.&nbsp; The REA
made us more comfortable.&nbsp; The REA also destroyed us.&nbsp; Destroyed
something - some intangible security people have always enjoyed in isolation.&nbsp;
The world came to our house on those shining, singing wires.&nbsp; The
world came in, intruding and changing, commanding us to obey its hypnotic
lure.&nbsp; The world came in like a torrent, pouring out of every motor
and gadget and instant, fumeless light, and it changed us.î</TD>
