<p>(<i>Light on </i><strong>DIRECTORS</strong>. <i>Six </i><strong>DIRECTORS </strong><i>are seated back of long cut-out desk, right. </i><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong> <i>paces back and forth in front of desk. The others follow him with their eyes, much as spectators at a tennis match follow the ball. An atmosphere of tenseness prevails. The projection is the interior of a board-room.</i>) 

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong> (<i>finally stops and swings around to </i><strong>DIRECTORS</strong>): Well, gentlemen, have you nothing to suggest? Hasn't anybody got an idea? (<i>They just look at him helplessly</i>) This company of ours is one of the soundest in the country. It took years to do that, gentlemen. It didn't happen over night. (<i>Intently</i>) Do you know that Knoxville and Chattanooga have applied to the Government for service? Do you know that municipal plants are being built every day in our territory <i>Do you know that the Government is driving us out of business?</i>

<p><strong>FIRST DIRECTOR</strong>: We've taken it to the Courts, Sam.

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: It's not enough. Suppose we lose. I tell you, it's a different kind of fight we've got to make. This is dog eat dog!

<p><strong>SECOND DIRECTOR</strong>: We can't buck the Government, Sam.

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: We don't have to buck 'em. We can stop 'em another way. (<i>He pauses, then slowly</i>:) Gentlemen, I hereby suggest a good stiff cut in rates &#151; maybe forty per cent. (<i>They all jump up, excitedly.</i>) 

<p><strong>SECOND DIRECTOR</strong>: We can't do that!

<p><strong>THIRD DIRECTOR</strong>: What about our stockholders!

<p><strong>FOURTH DIRECTOR</strong>: What about our dividends!

<p><strong>FIFTH DIRECTOR</strong>: What about our investment!

<p><strong>SIXTH DIRECTOR</strong>: The boys are right, Sam. We're losing ground every day. Our figures are way down. But if we cut forty per cent off, they'll only be three-fifths of what they are now!

<p><strong>ALL</strong>: He's right! We can't do it! Suicide, that's what it is!

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: Just a moment, gentlemen. I do not propose to cut rates and let it go at that. We've got to do more than that. <i>We've got to get new customers! </i><strong>["...by November, 1933, TVA was ready to begin construction. It was right then that the Tennessee Electric Power Company developed overnight interest in the district it had neglected for so years." &#151; <i>New York Daily News, </i>August 20, 1936.] </strong>And we've got to make the old ones use more juice!

<p><strong>SIXTH DIRECTOR</strong>: Where'll we get these new customers?

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: On the farms. In the towns. We've got to open up the whole valley! (<i>He leans forward</i>) Not only will this help business, but it will establish a right of way, a franchise. The Government won't run lines parallel to anybody else's. <i>If we get in there first, that farm is ours! </i>Do I make myself clear? (<i>A</i> <i>pause as they all look at him</i>) All those in favor? 

<p><strong>CHORUS</strong>: Aye!
