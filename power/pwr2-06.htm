<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: The minority opinion.

<p><strong>VOICE OF MC REYNOLDS</strong>: The record leaves no room for doubt that the primary purpose was to put the Federal Government into the business of distributing and selling electric power through certain large districts, to expel the power companies which had long serviced them.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Which had long serviced them!

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: The majority opinion, Chief Justice Hughes. 

<p><strong>VOICE OF HUGHES</strong>: ...Water power, the right to convert it into electric energy, and the electric energy thus produced constitute property belonging to the United States. Authority to dispose of property constitutionally acquired by the United States is expressly granted to the Congress by Section Three of Article Four of the Constitution of the United States.<strong> [<i>New York Times, </i>February 18, 1936.]</strong>

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: The Congress shall have power to dispose of, and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States, and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States. <strong>[Constitution of the United States]</strong>

<p><strong>VOICE OF HUGHES</strong>: We come then to the question of the method which has been adopted in disposing of the surplus energy generated at the Wilson Dam. That method, of course, must be an appropriate means of disposition according to the nature of the property, and it must be one adopted in the public interest as distinguished from private or personal ends.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: In the public interest!

<p><strong>BUSINESS MAN</strong>: There are twelve billion dollars invested in the electric industry.<strong> [McCarter, Thomas N., "Memorial to the President of the United States," December 17, 1934.]</strong> Are we, the stockholders, the public interest?

<p><strong>CITY DWELLER</strong>: There are millions of us city folks who stand to gain if rates are cut. The money saved will buy more food and clothing. Are we the public interest?

<p><strong>CONSUMER-AT-LARGE</strong>: If monopoly is necessary we must have a yardstick to do the work of competition and keep rates down. Are we the public interest?

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: <i>Who is the public interest?</i>

<p>(<i>The </i><strong>MEN </strong><i>turn toward Supreme Court bench as lights fade out.</i>) 

<p><strong>VOICE OF HUGHES</strong>: The question of the constitutional right of the Government to acquire or operate local or urban distribution systems is not involved.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Governor Hill McAlister of Tennessee. (<i>Light on platform.</i>) 

<p><strong>GOVERNOR MC ALISTER</strong>: This is the first break we've got. As Governor I am gratified at the decision, since it means so much to Tennessee. I have always been a backer of TVA and this ruling settles the whole business. <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong>

<p>(<i>The people brush the confetti from their clothes, and start walking around slowly, dejectedly. During this action all lights except the blue side-lights dim slowly out.</i>) 

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong> (<i>continuing</i>): Thus nineteen utility companies put a temporary blight on the hopes of the people of the Tennessee Valley. The injunction means immediate dismissal to six hundred and fifty workers in TVA, the paralyzing of an amazing social program <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong>. People awaiting the coming of cheap power must wait longer and longer while lawyers and courts untangle constitutional questions. But the people of the Valley decide to <i>fight....</i>

<p>(<i>The lights dim down to one-fourth. The scrim comes in, and movies of TVA activity are shown.</i>) 

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Again the question marches toward ultimate decision by the Supreme Court...

Upon it will rest the social and economic welfare of the people of the Tennessee Valley...
