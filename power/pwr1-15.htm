<p>(<i>Movies of Tennessee Valley come on scrim. They are integrated with the following </i><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong> <i>announcements:</i>) 

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: In the Tennessee Valley.... Parts of seven States, 40,000 square miles, two million people. All living in a region blighted by the misuse of land, and by the wash of small streams carrying away the fertile topsoil. In these cabins, life has changed but little since some pioneer wagon broke down a century ago, and for them this became the promised land. Occupations &#151; when they exist at all &#151; are primitive, a throwback to an earlier America. Here stand the results of poor land, limited diet, insufficient schooling, inadequate medical care, no plumbing, industry, agriculture or electrification! (<i>Front traveler curtain opens. Light comes up very slowly on </i><strong>FARMER </strong><i>and </i><strong>WIFE</strong>, <i>left, while movies are still on</i>) Meanwhile, the entire country seeks cheap electric power, and the demand for a cost yardstick comes from every section. In the Tennessee Valley, 1933. (<i>Scrim goes up.</i>)

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong> What's the matter with it?

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: What's the matter with it? You're squinting down your nose like you had a bug on the end of it!

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: Same light I been usin' for the last twenty years.

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Yeah, and look at you now. Them glasses are thick enough to fry eggs under if we ever got any sun in this dump!

<p><strong>FARMER </strong>(<i>quietly</i>): Andy Jackson used a lamp like this, Nora.

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Then it was just too bad for Andy. Besides, they didn't have electricity in them days.

<p><strong>FARMER </strong>(<i>folding paper and putting it down</i>): Maybe I better read durin' the day.

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: That's right. Don't do nothing about it. Just give in and don't make no fuss, and everybody'll love you.

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: What you want me to do, Nora? The wick's up as high as it'll go.

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Never mind the wick! How about a couple of nice little electric lights around here?

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: You heard what Joe Frank said. His farm's bigger'n mine. He can use more lights, and the company told him, nothin' doin'.

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: So, you and Joe are gettin' up a little club to read in the daytime, eh? (<i>She rises</i>) Suppose they told you you couldn't have any air, would you stop breathin'?

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: What's that got to do with it?

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Light's just as important as air.

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: Sure it is, but...

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Don't "but" me! Why don't you go out and do somethin' about it?

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: Nora, if they don't want to string lights out to my farm I can't make 'em. (<strong>FARMER </strong><i>rises.</i>) 

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Who said you can't? Who says you can't go up there and raise holy blazes until they give 'em to you! Tell 'em you're an American citizen! Tell 'em you're sick and tired of lookin' at fans and heaters and vacuums and dish-washin' machines in catalogues, that you'd like to <i>use </i>'em for a change! Tell 'em... (<i>She</i> <i>stops</i>)<i>... </i>What the hell do you think Andy Jackson you're always talkin' about would do in a case like this! (As <i>he stands, convinced, she claps his hat on his head, and gives him a push</i>) Now go on out and tell 'em somethin'!

<p><strong>WIFE</strong> (<i>Flippantly</i>): No, darling. We burn it.

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: But good Lord, I only pay thirty-five dollars a month rent for this whole house!

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: What's that got to do with it?

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: It seems all out of proportion, one-fifth for electricity. If this keeps up I'll have to cut down my life insurance.

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: Of course, if I had the kind of wife who turned the lights off when she walked out of a room I wouldn't have to. (<i>Rises, stands left of table.</i>)

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: And me get down on my hands and knees? Not on your life!

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: How about the washing machine? You used to send the stuff out.

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Yeah, and your shirts came back without cuffs. Remember?

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: Well, we've got to do something. You got any ideas?

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: I got one.

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: What is it?

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Did it ever occur to you that maybe those electric companies are charging too much?

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: Sure it did. But what can I do about it? Bump my head against the wall?

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: No, but you can complain to the State Electric Commission.

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: Look, dear. I'm just one little consumer. How can I fight a utility?

<p><strong>WIFE</strong>: Tell the Commission. That's what they're there for.

<p><strong>HUSBAND</strong>: Why, they won't even listen to me.

<p><strong>WIFE</strong> (<i>rises</i>): Make 'em. Tell 'em that your taxes are paying their salaries. Tell 'em that that's what they're there for, to regulate things. Tell 'em you're sick and tired of making dividends for somebody else and it's about time the little fellow got a look-in some place. And tell 'em... (<i>She stops</i>)<i>... </i>tell 'em you'll be damned if you'll give up listening to those football games on Saturday afternoon! (<i>She thrusts hat at him</i>) Now get goin'! (<i>He does.</i>)

<p><strong>MANAGER</strong>: <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong> Certainly, Mr. Parker. You can have all the lights you want. All you've got to do is pay for the cost of poles and wires.

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: But I haven't got four hundred dollars! And my farm's mortgaged up to the hilt already. (<i>Desperately</i>) Can't you see? If I could only get juice I could get me an electric churn and make enough money to pay for the poles!

<p><strong>MANAGER</strong>: I'm sorry, Mr. Parker, but that's the way we operate. I'm afraid I can't do a thing for you.

<p><strong>FARMER</strong>: And I got to go on livin' the rest of my life with a kerosene lamp and a hand churn like my grandfather did when he came here?

<p><strong>COMMISSIONER</strong>: <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong> Have you had your meter tested?

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: Yes, I've had it tested twice. The meter's all right, but the bills are too high just the same.

<p><strong>COMMISSIONER</strong>: Mr. Clark, you're not paying one cent more for your electricity than anybody else.

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: I know that! That's what the trouble is, we're <i>all </i>paying too much!

<p><strong>COMMISSIONER</strong>: Mr. Clark, the company that sells you is working on a margin of seven to eight per cent. We consider that a fair profit. And so will you, if you're a business man.

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: Look, Mr. Commissioner. I'm not asking you to argue with me on behalf of the utilities. I am a taxpayer! I'm paying your salary I want you to go and argue with them! What's the Commission for, if it's not to help guys like me?

<p><strong>COMMISSIONER</strong>: Mr. Clark, the law permits any private enterprise to make a fair return on its investment.

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: It does, eh?

<p><strong>COMMISSIONER</strong>: And the law permits any company to charge any rate so long as that fair profit is maintained.

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: It does, eh? Well, tell me this: If laws like that are made for utilities, why aren't laws made to help people like me?
