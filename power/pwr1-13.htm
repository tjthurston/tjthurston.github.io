<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: The word goes out, "Get Norris!" &#151; Broken Bow, Nebraska, 1930. A gentleman does a little shopping. <strong>[<i>New York Times, July </i>4, 1930, <i>et supra. New Republic, </i>Vol. 64, p. l93,and Vol. 65, p. l79.]</strong>

<p>(<i>Light up on the counter of a grocery store, </i>right, <i>at which stands a clerk. Projection is a grocery window. </i><strong>POLITICIAN </strong><i>enters.</i>) 

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: What can I do for you, sir?

<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: Oh, nothing much. I'll just look around a little. (<i>Picks up an apple</i>) Nice-looking apples.

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: Yes, sir. Them's McIntoshes. Good for cookin' and eatin'.

<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: You don't say. (<i>Pause</i>) How's business?

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: Not so good. Looks like a hard winter comin' on.

<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: Seems to me there's always a way for a smart man to help things along a little.

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: How do you mean, bootleg?

<p><strong>POLITICIAN </strong>(<i>laughing</i>): No, of course not I mean something honest, where you get a nice return and all you've got to do is lend your name.

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: I ain't signin' nobody's notes, mister. I got caught that way once before.

<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: You don't have to sign anything, Mr. Norris.

<p><strong>GROCER </strong>(<i>quickly</i>): How'd you know my name?

<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: Oh, I've heard about you. It's George W. Norris, isn't it?

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: That's right, though I'm mighty curious to know how you found it out.

<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: I have ways. Now about this proposition of mine. How would you like to become a candidate for the Republican nomination for United States Senator from Nebraska?

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: Me?

<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: Certainly! You're as good a man as anyone else for the job and I think you ought to get it.

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: But there is a Senator named George W. Norris!

<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: I know that, too. And he's up for renomination this year.

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: But I don't think...


<p><strong>POLITICIAN</strong>: It might help you over this long hard winter you're expecting, and who knows, you might even be nominated! (A <i>pause as they regard each other &#151; and then a handclasp, as the lights dim to half. </i><strong>POLITICIAN </strong><i>exits right. </i><strong>GROCER </strong><i>remains standing.</i>) 

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: In an attempt to confuse the voters the name of this man was placed alongside the real George W. Norris, but the Supreme Court of Nebraska ruled it out!

<p><i>Blackout</i>

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: It was later revealed that $400,000 had been spent to defeat Senator Norris.
