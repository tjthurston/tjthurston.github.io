<p>(<i>Lights up on </i><strong>FATHER</strong> <i>and </i><strong>DAUGHTER</strong>, <i>center. He is seated in chair; she is sitting on the floor playing with large alphabet blocks. Projection represents a Christmas tree and teddy bear.</i>) 

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: Daddy, where do we get electricity from?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong> (<i>annoyed at the interruption</i>): We get it from the electric company.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: Where does the company get it?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: They generate it.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: What's "generate" mean?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: Generate means... means... can't you see Daddy is busy? Why don't you play with your blocks, dear?

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: How do they generate it, Daddy?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: Oh.... (<i>under his breath</i>) Damn! Sometimes they run dynamos with steam engines and sometimes they run dynamos with water.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: What is a dynamo?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: Well, a dynamo is... What the devil do you want to know that for?

<p><strong>GIRL</strong> (<i>after a pause</i>): I know. A dynamo is what they make electricity with. We had that in school.

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: Well, why didn't you get the rest in school?

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: What would happen if the company wouldn't give us electricity any more?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: We'd be in a hell of a fix.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: Then why doesn't the Government give us electricity?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: Because it would be competing with private business, and, besides, everybody knows that the Government wouldn't be efficient.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong> (<i>pauses, apparently thinking</i>): Daddy, who runs the Post Office?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: The Government runs the Post Office.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: Why does the Government run the Post Office?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: Because it's too important to us to permit anybody else to run it.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: Well, Daddy, don't you think electricity is important? You said we'd be in a hell of a fix if the company quit giving it to us.

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: Watch your language, young lady!

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: It was what you said, Daddy.

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: The Post Office and electric lights are different.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong> (<i>stands up, holding the blocks in her arm</i>): Daddy, who is the Government?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: The Government is you and me, I guess &#151; the people.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: Do all the people need electricity?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: Yes.

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: And does the company own what all the people need?

<p><strong>FATHER</strong>: That's right! 

<p><strong>GIRL</strong>: Gee, Daddy; the people are awfully dumb. (<i>She drops the blocks.</i>)
