<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: According to the Federal Trade Commission Report, the public utilities spend twenty-five million dollars every year on propaganda and publicity. Twenty-five million dollars! <strong>[Federal Trade Commission Report, Vol. 71-A, p. 60.]</strong>

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: <strong>[Fictional character, scene based on report of Federal Trade Commission.]</strong> Your paper's a darn good one, Mr. Bigbee, and honest, too. And the farmers in four counties around here swear by it like they do the Bible. And by the way... (<i>He</i> <i>stops and points to paper spread out on desk</i>)<i> ... </i>there's a letter in here some place about electric rates being too high and that the Government ought to do something about it.... 

 <p><strong>EDITOR</strong>: <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong> Yeah, that's from Joe Bailey. He's one of our subscribers. He's hepped on the subject of Government ownership.

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: Of course what he says is just plain silly. He doesn't know the facts in the case at all. But we're going to answer it just the same.

<p><strong>EDITOR</strong>: I'll be glad to print a letter from you, Mr. Crane.

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: My company doesn't write letters, Mr. Bigbee. We're going to answer that with a full page ad!

<p><strong>EDITOR </strong>(<i>happily</i>):<i> A </i>full page ad!

<p><strong>MAN </strong>(<i>rises</i>): That's right, a full page. I'll have the copy over here tomorrow.

<p><strong>EDITOR</strong>: I certainly do appreciate this, Mr. Crane. <strong>[Fictitious name.]</strong>

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: Forget it. (<i>Starts off, stops</i>) Oh, by the way. Since we're paying out so much money to answer that letter, anything you publish in the future should be in the form of paid advertisements, too; they pay to squawk and we pay to answer 'em. That's only fair, isn't it?

<p><strong>EDITOR</strong>: It seems fair, only...

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: There'll be a clause to that effect in our contract.

<p><strong>EDITOR</strong>: But people like Joe Bailey haven't got any money. They can't afford to pay for an ad!

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: Can't they?

<p><strong>EDITOR</strong>: And then their letters won't appear at all!

<p><strong>MAN</strong>: Won't they? (<i>Pause, as he regards him significantly</i>) So long, Mr. Bigbee.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: According to the Federal Trade Commission Report, Mr. J. L. Murphy, of the Georgia Railway and Power Company, says...

<p>(<i>Lights come up on </i><strong>MURPHY </strong><i>down right.</i>) 

<p><strong>MURPHY</strong>: The result of our efforts is that out of two hundred and fifty newspapers in Georgia, only four will publish anything at all from the public ownership people! <strong>[Raushenbush, H. S., <i>High Power Propaganda,</i> p. 11.]</strong>

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Mr. Willard Cope, Executive Secretary of the Georgia Utilities Information Committee, is interrogated by the Federal Trade Commission. Counsel, Robert E. Healy...<strong>[<i>New York Times,</i> May 11, 1928.]</strong>

<p>(<i>Lights come up on </i><strong>COPE</strong> <i>seated in chair. Beside him stands </i><strong>HEALY</strong>. <i>Behind them is projected a heavily draped window, with the capitol dome showing in the distance.</i>) 

<p><strong>HEALY</strong>: Mr. Cope, why were the records we asked for destroyed?

<p><strong>COPE</strong> (<i>unruffled, a hit debonair</i>): Oh, we just didn't want them kicking around the office, that's all.

<p><strong>HEALY</strong>: Now in reference to this propaganda and information...

<p><strong>COPE</strong> (<i>breaking in</i>): Mr. Commissioner, my organization has done nothing in the six years I have been with it that can be called propaganda for the utilities or anybody else!

<p><strong>HEALY</strong>: Then how do you explain this voucher showing that you paid for subscriptions to the <i>Columbus Enquirer-Sun </i>of Columbus, Georgia, a newspaper which has consistently upheld the utilities and attacked any form of Government supervision or control? Now, isn't it true, Mr. Cope, that these subscriptions were sent by you to a great number of consumers of electricity? (A <i>pause, as </i><strong>COPE</strong> <i>doesn't answer</i>) Well, Mr. Cope, have you no answer to this charge?

<p><strong>COPE</strong> (<i>painfully</i>): I &#151; I &#151; did it in order to raise the general level of the intelligence of the State! That's all!

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: At a meeting of the Public Relations Section of the Southeast Division of the National Electric Light Association, M. H. Aylesworth, Managing Director, remarked...

<p>(<i>Lights come up on </i><strong>AYLESWORTH</strong>, <i>right.</i>) 

<p><strong>AYLESWORTH</strong>: All the money being spent is worth while. Don't be afraid of the expense. <i>The public pays!</i> <strong>[Federal Trade Commission Report, Vol. 71-A, p. 60.]</strong>

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: In the colleges.... The following members of a notoriously underpaid profession find extra-curricular employment as lecturers, editors, and advisers for public utility corporations....

<p>(<i>General lighting on whole stage in blue. Projection is a light bulb with mortar-board cap. The </i><strong>PROFESSORS</strong>, <i>as their colleges are called, enter, one by one. Each wears a cap and gown, and is reading a book, greatly absorbed. They do not stop, but continue walking. As they enter, left and right, they cross each other. As the entrances are made from various depths of the stage, a formation is achieved of lines crisscrossing. Special music with a college flavor adds to effectiveness of this scene.</i>) 

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: A professor from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute &#151; eight thousand dollars; a professor from Yale &#151; eight thousand one hundred and seven dollars and twenty-five cents; Professor E. T., unattached &#151; five thousand dollars; a professor from Texas A. and M., three thousand three hundred dollars; a professor from Louisiana State University &#151; ten thousand dollars; a dean from Ohio State University &#151; fifteen thousand dollars.... These among hundreds of others were reported by the Federal Trade Commission Investigation.<strong> [Federal Trade Commission Report, Vol. 71-A, pp. 426-37.] </strong>It is also reported that thirty-five million dollars of Harvard funds are invested in utilities securities....<strong> [Federal Trade Commission Report, Vol. 71-A, pp. 174-75.]</strong> Now these men are entrusted with the education of a nation. Will they tell the <i>whole story </i>to their students, and jeopardize their incomes and their university endowments? Let's ask them.... Gentlemen ... (<i>They all stop still and close their books</i>)<i>... </i>gentlemen &#151; what do you think of the doctrine of municipal ownership? (<i>In unison, mournfully, they all shake their heads, indicating that they consider it entirely hopeless. </i><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>, <i>continuing:</i>) What do you think of Government supervision and control of the abuses we have shown to exist in the public utilities? (<i>Again they shake their heads</i>) What do you think of a nice juicy steak smothered in onions? (<i>The </i><strong>PROFESSORS</strong> <i>nod their heads energetically, with broad grins on their faces and very much interested.</i>)

<p><strong>SENATOR NORRIS</strong>: They have undertaken to control legislatures, public service commissions, members of Congress, school boards, municipal authorities, commercial clubs, secret societies, women's clubs &#151; even Boy Scout organizations.... No one would find fault if these influences were operating in public &#151; out in the open!
