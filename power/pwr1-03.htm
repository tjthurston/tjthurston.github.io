<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Nineteen hundred: Dividends rise, stockholders are happy and electric consumption increases. But where is the man who uses it? Where is this consumer? Let's have a look at him!

<p>(<i>Arc is played all over stage, searching for </i><strong>CONSUMER</strong>. <i>It finally picks him out, upstage, right.</i>) 

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Ah, there he is!

<p>(<i>The </i><strong>CONSUMER</strong> <i>is a meek-looking little man dressed in the period. He sits on a chair. The arc should grow larger until it takes in a good part of the stage, and there, tucked away in one little corner, is the </i><strong>CONSUMER</strong>. <i>When he is finally discovered he gets up and comes downstage, center, and there is projected "C is for Consumer." Front spotlight follows him all through scene.</i>) 

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: What do you pay for electricity, Mister?

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: Too much. Seventeen cents a kilowatt hour. <strong>[Edison Electric Institute <i>Bulletin </i>No. 3, June 3, 1936, p. 6.]</strong>

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: What's a kilowatt hour?

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: I don't know. That's what it says on the bill. (<i>Reads it</i>) Thirty-nine kilowatt hours at seventeen cents per hour, total six sixty-three.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: You're paying for it, but you don't know what a kilowatt hour is. How many ounces in a pound?

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: Sixteen.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: How many quarts in a gallon?

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: Four.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: How many inches in a yard?

<p><strong>ELECTRICIAN</strong> (<i>calling, off</i>): Hey, Mike! Drop that work light. (<i>The work light comes down</i>) Now light it up. Now when this thousand-watt bulb burns for an hour that's a kilowatt hour.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong> (<i>after a pause</i>): Is that all?

<p><strong>ELECTRICIAN</strong>: That's all. The word comes from the Greek, <i>chilioi, </i>meaning thousand, and "watt" meaning watt &#151; chilioi-watt or kilowatt. Anything else?

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong> (<i>weakly</i>): No, thank you.

<p><strong>ELECTRICIAN</strong>: O.K., Mike, kill it.

<p>(<i>Work light goes up. </i><strong>ELECTRICIAN</strong> <i>exits, whistling. The projection becomes "K is for Kilowatt."</i>) 

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: Now that I know what it is, I still think I'm paying too much.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: The company that services you is only making a fair profit.

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: What's a fair profit?

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Six to nine per cent.

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: Who said so?

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: The Courts.

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: And the bank only gives me three! <strong>[Wm. B. Dana &amp; Co., <i>Annual Financial Review, </i>Igol; <i>also Public Utility Rate Fixing, C. </i>E. Grunsky, 1918.]</strong> What do they do with all that money?

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: It goes back to the stockholders in dividends. (<i>Pause. The </i><strong>CONSUMER</strong> <i>picks up his shopping bag and starts off</i>) Where are you going?

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: I've got to do some shopping and I'm going to stop in at the company. I'll tell those people something! Seventeen cents a kilowatt hour!

<p><strong>MANAGER</strong>: There is no other fellow. (<i>Projection changes to "M is for Monopoly."</i>) 

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: You the only one selling electricity in this city? <strong>[<i>Electrical World Engineer, </i>Vol. 35, No. 7, p. 242. Feb. 17, 1900.]</strong>

<p><strong>MANAGER</strong>: That's right.

<p><strong>CONSUMER</strong>: And if I don't get it from you I have to do without it?

<p><strong>MANAGER</strong>: That's right. Would you like us to discontinue service?
