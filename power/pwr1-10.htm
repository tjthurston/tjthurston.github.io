<p><strong>LANE</strong> (<i>to audience, excitedly</i>): Did you hear that? Three seventy over four-thirty-five, showing, in the face of increases of from  sixty-two to ninety-eight per cent in essentials like food, household goods, clothing and rent, <strong>[<i>World Almanac, </i>1936, p. 364.]</strong> a decrease in the cost of electricity of almost fifteen per cent.<strong> [Based on figures from <i>Electrical World, </i>January 7, 1928.]</strong> Fifteen per cent!

<p><strong>LANE</strong>: Not that I can think of.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Isn't it true that the more electricity you sell, the cheaper its cost? And isn't it true that the domestic consumption of electricity has gone up something like four hundred and thirty-five per cent since 1913? <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong> 

<p><strong>LANE</strong>: Well, yes, only...

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: And isn't it true that engineering advances from 1913 to 1926 have reduced the operating expenses for one domestic kilowatt hour forty-one per cent? <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong>

<p><strong>LANE</strong>: Yes, but...

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: And isn't it true that the gross domestic revenues went up two hundred and seventy-five per cent? <strong>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</strong>

<p><strong>LANE</strong>: Yes, yes, yes.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: And that is why, Mr. Lane, we say that, judging from your cost sheets, though your rates have gone down, <i>they have not gone down nearly enough! </i>Good day, Mr. Lane.
