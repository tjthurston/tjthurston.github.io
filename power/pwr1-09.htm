<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: A lesson in high finance. Presenting Samuel J. Insull of Chicago.

<p>(<i>Light comes up on </i><strong>INSULL </strong><i>and </i><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>, <i>seated center.</i>) 

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: Now, son, just sit still and watch me and I'm going to show you how to make a lot of money.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: What do I have to do?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: Just keep quiet and when I need you I'll let you know.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Samuel J. Insull organizes the Middle West Utilities Company, president, Samuel J. Insull, capitalization nothing, assets nothing, holdings nothing. Samuel J. Insull sells the Middle West Utilities Company, president, Samuel J. Insull, $330,000 worth of securities. <strong>["Up and Down with Insull", <i>Collier's, </i>December 17, 1932.]</strong>

<p>(<i>A projection of a stock certificate appears &#151; as </i><strong>INSULL</strong> <i>takes securities out of his pocket.</i>) 

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: Don t be a sucker. They haven't got any dough!

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: To raise the money to pay Samuel J. Insull, the Middle West Utilities Company issues ten million dollars' worth of stock, all of which the Middle West Utilities Company, Samuel <i>J. </i>Insull, president, sells to Samuel J.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong> (<i>as </i><strong>INSULL</strong> <i>takes stocks from his pants pocket and transfers them to his coat</i>): There's something funny going on here.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: But Samuel Insull hasn't got a nickel in the world to pay for these stocks.

<p><strong>INSULL</strong> (<i>turns to </i><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>, <i>smiling</i>): Now, son, I'd like to talk to you.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: Who, <i>me?</i>

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: What is this, a touch?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: What kind of car do you drive, son?

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: A Chevrolet. Why?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: How would you like to own a sixteen-cylinder Cadillac, all new and shiny, with a footman and a chauffeur? (<strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong> <i>regards him ecstatically.</i>) 

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: How would you like to exchange that little house of yours for a real home on Long Island, with one hundred and sixty-eight rooms, a string of polo ponies and nine swimming pools? (<i>During the above, the </i><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong> <i>becomes more and more interested; he nods, a big grin on his face.</i>) 

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: How would you like to go around the world, Cathay, Mocha and Java, on your own yacht &#151; the biggest in the world &#151; with your wife and kids following you, each one with a yacht of his own, just a wee bit smaller than yours? (<i>The </i><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong> <i>nods more eagerly.</i>) 

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: How would you like to go up to your boss and say, "Mr. Simmons, I quit. I'm tired of being a wage slave for guys like you to kick around. I invested my money judiciously, I did, and from now on I'm going to live on the dividends from my stocks in the Middle West Utilities Company! (<i>The </i><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong> <i>nods as though his head were coming off</i>) You're a smart boy, son, and I like you. And I want you to know I wouldn't cheat you for the world.

<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: Samuel J. Insull sells half his shares to the public for four million dollars, which he hands over to Middle West Utilities Company. <strong>["Up and Down with Insull," <i>Collier's, </i>December 17, 1932.]</strong> (<strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong> <i>hands </i><strong>INSULL</strong> <i>money in exchange for stocks.</i>) 

<p><strong>INSULL</strong> (<i>stuffing money in all his pockets </i><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong> <i>regards stocks</i>): That's right, look at the pretty pictures.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong> (<i>eagerly</i>): How much is the dividend going to be, Sam?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: Well, that depends on how much we make.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: How do we know how much we make? 

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: Why, I write it down in the books.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: Can anybody look at the books?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: Oh, no. This is a holding company. We don't have to show our books to anybody.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: Who decides how we're going to invest our money?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: I do.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: Who decides how much your salary's going to be?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: I do.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: And who decides if you're going to give yourself a bonus?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: I do.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: Why?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: Why? Because I still own fifty per cent of the shares in this company and that gives me a controlling interest.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: You mean the company that I put into business with my four million?

<p><strong>INSULL</strong>: That's right.

<p><strong>CONSUMER-INVESTOR</strong>: Well, how much have you got invested in it?
