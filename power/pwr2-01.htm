<p><strong>LOUDSPEAKER</strong>: 1935, Dayton, Tennessee.

<p>(<i>Light on group, right. Six small-town </i><strong>BUSINESS MEN</strong> <i>seated on boxes. A grocery store interior is projected.</i>) 

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong> (<i>probably insurance agent</i>): ...Now here's the situation: The company's chargin' us five and a half cents. If we get the juice from TVA it'll cost us two and a half or less. Now, what're we goin' to do about it?

<p><strong>BARBER </strong>(<i>in his working clothes</i>): Seems pretty silly to get me down here to answer a question like that. Let's get it from the Government! (<i>Stands up and takes step toward center</i>) So long, boys. I got a fellow in the chair who's waitin' for a shave.

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: Wait a minute, Joe. The Government won't supply us with juice while another company's in here.

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: You mean we got to pay double just because there's a company in here already... that if we didn't have light and power, the Government could come in and we'd save fifty per cent?

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: That's right. But they won't compete with private industry.

<p><strong>BUTCHER</strong>: Then the company's still top dog.

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: That's the way it looks.... I had a talk with 'em this morning, and they won't cut rates. Say they're down to the bone now. Cut 'em and they'll show a loss.

<p><strong>BUTCHER</strong>: At two and a half cents I could have that electric refrigerator in the store.


<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: And I could electrify the whole business &#151; coffee grinder, slicing machine and all.

<p><strong>BARBER</strong>: Let's do something about it.

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: Seems to me there's two things we can do. We can either buy out the plant...

<p><strong>BARBER</strong>: With what?

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: I'm coming to that &#151; or we can build our own plant. Lots of other towns have 'em.

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: What'll we use for money?

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: The Government will lend it to us at three per cent and we can pay it back in twenty-five years out of the profits.

<p><strong>BUTCHER</strong>: Will there be any profits?

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: At two and a half cents we'll make enough each year not only to pay off the debt, but to light every street in town and maybe take care of the pavin' too. (Ex<i>citedly</i>) Now here's the proposition. (<i>Stands up</i>) We go to the company and ask them to cut rates. If they won't cut we offer to buy 'em out. And if...

<p><strong>GROCER</strong>: And if they won't sell...

<p><strong>CHAIRMAN</strong>: By God, we'll build our own! (<i>Slowly, after a pause</i>) All those in favor? 

<p><strong>CHORUS</strong>: Aye.
