<a name="1"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> WITH more than 235,000 young men enrolled, President Roosevelt's plan to have 275,000 unemployed men in forest work camps by July 1 is nearing successful conclusion. On June 8 more than 80,000 men were established in 400 forest camps, while 155,000 were in conditioning camps. These will be transferred to the work camps at the rate of nearly 9,000 a day.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> At the same time it was announced that 8,000 unemployed war veterans from nine eastern states would be sent to Vermont on flood control work on July 1. The remaining 19,500, of the 27,500 quota allowed the veterans, have not been assigned. On the Indian Reservations more than 3,000 Indians have been accepted for conditioning. The quota allowed the Indians is 14,400. Alaska's quota of 325 and Porto Rico's of 1,200 are expected to be filled by early July. Thus, within four weeks it is expected that more than 318,000 men will be in Civilian Conservation Corps work camps.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> Approximately 16,000 civilians, including technical foresters, construction foremen, supervisors and others needed to supervise the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps while in the forest camps, have been employed, it was stated.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> All of the forest work camps, totaling 1,437, have been selected, every state having at least one camp.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> To maintain the morale and discipline in the camps, President Roosevelt on June 12 approved an Executive order increasing the cash allowances to be paid thirteen per cent of the men enrolled in the Corps, and a new penalty system for minor offenses committed by the enrolled personnel.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The new regulations will provide that not more than five per cent of the authorized strength of any Civilian Conservation Corps Company may be paid a cash allowance of $45 a month while an additional eight per cent may be paid a cash allowance of $36 a month. The previous regulations provided for a flat cash allowance of $30 a month for each enrolled man. The new rate will go into effect on July 1.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The men who will receive the higher cash allowance rates. will be selected by the company commander and the camp superintendent for each camp, and will be utilized in the administration of the camps and in some cases in the overseeing of the work to be performed in the forests.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The penalty system will include penalties comparable to those customarily imposed by the management of industrial enterprises "in order to maintain efficiency of production anal equality of opportunity and privileges." Penalties authorized may include: admonition, suspension of privileges, substitution of specified duties within the camp instead of the regular work for a maximum period of one week, or deduction of not to exceed three days cash allowance per month.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> According to Robert Fechner, Director of Emergency Conservation Work, the recent appeal to state governors to submit applications for the establishment of work projects on state and privately owned land has been received enthusiastically.<p>

<a name="10"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> "The result is," Mr. Fechner said, "that sufficient work projects have now been approved to care for the full quota of men."<p>

<a name="11"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The success of the move to place 275,000 men in work camps by July 1 is assured, Mr. Fechner said. "At the present time virtually all Army posts and stations set aside for conditioning men are filled to capacity. To make room for the men yet to be enrolled, the War Department has kept a steady stream of men moving toward the forest work camps. In some cases it has been necessary to send men across the continent from eastern states with few forest work projects to the heavily forested areas of the Pacific Coast. Wherever possible, however, men are being sent to work projects within their own states."<p>

<a name="12"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The transportation of men from the East to West was initiated on May 24 when administrative cadres of thirty-two companies were dispatched to Utah and Idaho from Fort Monroe, Virginia, and Fort Meade, Maryland. Each train carried sixteen regular Army officers, sixty-four enlisted men and 336 members of the Civilian Conservation Corps.<p>

<a name="13"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The 1,437 forest work camps selected and approved to take care of the entire Corps have been designated as follows: National Forests, 573; State Forests, 321; private land, 220; state parks, 101; National Parks, 62; other Federal Reservations, 18; and on special erosion and flood control work, 122.<p>

<a name="14"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> In the First Corps Area, Connecticut will have fourteen camps, Maine fifteen camps, Massachusetts thirty-two, New Hampshire thirteen, Rhode Island three, and Vermont, not including camps for war veterans, thirteen. Approximately 18,000 men will be stationed in the Area.<p>

<a name="15"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The Second Corps Area will have forty-two camps, designated as follows: Delaware one, New Jersey nine, and New York thirty-two. More than 8,000 men will be put to work.<p>

<a name="16"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The Third Corps Area, affording work for 31,000 men, will have 156 camps--eleven in Maryland, ninety-seven in Pennsylvania, and forty-eight in Virginia.<p>

<a name="17"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> In the Fourth Corps Area, with a total of 198 camps, Alabama will have seventeen, Florida twenty-two, Georgia thirty-nine, Louisiana twenty-three, Mississippi sixteen, North Carolina thirty, South Carolina eighteen, and Tennessee thirty-three. The area will employ nearly 40,000 men.<p>

<a name="18"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> Seventy-four camps will be established in the Fifth Corps Area, taking care of 15,000 men. Indiana will have twenty-one, Kentucky seventeen, Ohio eighteen, and West Virginia eighteen.<p>

<a name="19"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The Sixth Corps Area, with a total of 139 camps, and accommodating 27,000 men, will give Illinois thirty-three camps, Michigan fifty-nine, and Wisconsin forty-seven.<p>

<a name="20"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The Seventh Corps Area will take care of 30,000 men in 154 camps. Arkansas will have twenty-eight, Iowa sixteen, Kansas seven, Minnesota sixty-one, Missouri sixteen, Nebraska five, North Dakota seven, and South Dakota fifteen.<p>

<a name="21"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> In the Eighth Corps Area there will be 120 camps for 24,000 men. Twenty have been allotted to Arizona, twenty-five to Colorado, fifteen to New Mexico, sixteen to Oklahoma, thirty-four to Texas, and ten to Wyoming.<p>

<a name="22"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> More than 84,000 men will be put to work in the Ninth Corps Area. Camps approved total 460. California will have 148, Idaho ninety-six, Montana thirty-one, Nevada four, Oregon sixty-four, Utah twenty-six, Washington fifty-seven, and Wyoming fourteen.<p>

<a name="23"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> Of the 400 camps already "manned," 67 are on the National Forests ninety-four on state forests and parks, twenty-four on privately owned land, and fifteen in the National Parks.<p>

<a name="24"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The 8,000 unemployed war veterans which have been assigned to erosion control work in Vermont will be selected as follows: New York, 2,575; Pennsylvania, 1,950; Massachusetts, 875; New Jersey, 825; Connecticut, 325; Rhode Island, 150; Maine, 150; New Hampshire, 100; and Vermont, 75. An additional 1,000 veterans will be drawn from Virginia.<p>

<a name="25"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The War Department reports that the health of the majority of men in both conditioning and forest camps has been excellent. It was pointed out that the health record among the men was much better than the health reports from cities and towns in the United States. A small number of cases of pneumonia have been reported, but there have been no deaths.<p>

<a name="26"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> Scattered reports from the various Corps Areas indicate that great headway is being made in establishing work camps and work projects.<p>

<a name="27"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> From the Lake States, E. W. Tinker, Regional Forester, United States Forest Service, reports that at the present time the civilian foresters are working on projects consisting of reforestation forest fire hazard removal, improvement work such as the construction of telephone lines, truck trails, foot paths, firebreaks, portages, docks, fire lookout towers, ranger stations and cabins. Some men are engaged in water development work and the improvement of existing camp grounds. A great many have been assigned to forest culture work, he said including thinning, release cutting of suppressed trees so that the preferred species may make better growth. Later, he said crews will be assigned to the eradication of insect infestations, and a policy of preservation of roadside beauty.<p>

<a name="28"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> In the Southwest plans are being rushed for intensive work in the construction of horse and truck trails for forest fire protection, and in the building of fire lookout towers. The trail work has been under way for several weeks on a small scale. From California comes the report that the conservation work plan is progressing rapidly. George H. Cecil, inspector for southern California, reports that five camps have been established on the Angeles National Forest. In the northern part of the State the men will be engaged, according to plans now completed, in thirty different kinds of conservation work<p>

<a name="29"><font color="#228b22"><li></a></font> The welfare and recreational program for the camps is rapidly taking form. Each camp has been supplied with athletic equipment newspapers and magazines. <p>
