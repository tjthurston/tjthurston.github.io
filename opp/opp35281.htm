<I>LET US suppose him differently placed<br>
In wider fields than these bounded by bayous<br>
And the fringes of moss-hung trees<br>
Over which, in lazy spirals, the carancros soar and dip.<p>

Let us suppose these horizons pushed farther,<br>
So that his eager mind,<br>
His restless senses, his swift eyes,<br>
Could glean more than the sheaves he stored<br>
Time and time again:<br>
Let us suppose him far away from here.<p>

Or let us, keeping him here, suppose him<br>
More submissive, less ready for the torrent of hot Cajan speech,<br>
The clenched fist, the flushed face,<br>
The proud scorn and the spurting anger;<br>
Let us suppose him with his hat crumpled in his hand,<br>
The proper slant to his neck, the eyes abashed,<br>
Let us suppose his tender respect for his honor<br>
Calloused, his debt to himself outlawed.<p>

Let us suppose him what he could never be.<p>

Let us suppose him less thrifty<br>
Less the hustler from early morning until first dark,<br>
Let us suppose his corn weedy,<br>
His cotton rusty, scantily fruited, and his fat mules poor.<br>
His cane a sickly yellow<br>
Like his white neighbor's.<p>

Let us suppose his burnt brick color,<br>
His shining hair thrown back from his forehead,<br>
His stalwart shoulders, his lean hips,<br>
His gently fused patois of Cajan, Indian, African,<br>
Let us suppose these less the dragnet<br>
To her, who might have been less lonesome<br>
Less driven by Louisiana heat, by lone flat days,<br>
And less hungry.<p>

Let us suppose his full-throated laugh<br>
Less repulsive to the crabbed husband,<br>
Let us suppose his swinging strides<br>
Less of an insult to the half-alive scarecrow<br>
Of the neighboring fields:<br>
Let us suppose him less fermenting to hate.<p>

Let us suppose that there had been<br>
In this tiny forgotten parish, among these lost bayous,<br>
No imperative need<br>
Of preserving unsullied,<br>
Anglo-Saxon mastery.<p>

Let us suppose....<br>
Oh, let us suppose him alive.</I><p align=right>
