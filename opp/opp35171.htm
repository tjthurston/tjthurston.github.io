<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> THE recent outbreak in Harlem aroused some  fear that the black belt is going red. Fortunately,  however, it has directed at least temporary  attention to more fundamental social and  economic conditions there. In the hope of  contributing somewhat to a portrayal of one  phase of such conditions, this report of  diminishing family incomes in a section of  Harlem during the depression is given at this  time.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In  1933 the Milbank Memorial Fund conducted a house-to-house survey of 2061 Negro households in the area of lies  between 126th and 135th Streets  and between Lenox and Eighth  Avenues. The chief purpose of the  study was to secure birth rates and  sickness rates among Negroes of  different occupational and income  levels. This section, known as  Health Area 12, was chosen  because available census tract data  pertaining to rentals, infant  mortality, general mortality, and  tuberculosis mortality indicated it _  to be neither the best nor the worst economically or socially. It appeared to be a "middling" Harlem section.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The immediate occasion for undertaking the  survey in 1933 was the opportunity to secure  Negro "white-collar" investigators from the  Emergency Work and Relief Bureau. With the  help of white enumerators from the Bureau, a  similar investigation was carried out at the same time in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.  Contemporaneous with the above two studies  were essentially similar investigations conducted  in nine other cities by the United States Public  Health Service with the assistance of the  Milbank Memorial Fund. The additional studies  are mentioned as indications that the Harlem  study was not ill-prepared or hatched up only for  the purpose of giving employment to white-collar  workers. Several weeks of careful planning  intervened between the offer of help from the  Emergency Work and Relief Bureau and the  gradual launching of the field work. Each  enumerator was required to study the set of  instructions and to demonstrate a thorough  knowledge of the schedule before he was sent  to the field.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> At this time a description of data collected will  be confined to those aspects with which this  report deals. In addition to basic fertility and  morbidity data, the schedules provided for  detailed enumeration of the husband's usual  occupation and for entries of income of any  members of the household during the four years  1929-1932. The income data were solicited in a  detailed manner. The informants were asked to  state for each of the four years under  consideration the type of employment, regularity  of work and income received for any member of  the household who was gainfully employed  during any part of that time. In addition, the  schedule provided for entries concerning income from  renters, boarders or lodgers,  relief, aid received from  relatives, insurance benefits,  compensation, etc.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> On the basis of the husband's [ <a href="#**"><b>2</b></a> ] reported  usual occupation, the Harlem families surveyed  were classified into professional, proprietary,  clerical, skilled worker, and unskilled laborer  classes.[ <a href="#***"><b>3</b></a> ] As expected, the laboring classes  predominated in the sample. The skilled,  semi-skilled, and unskilled classes combined  comprised 84 per cent of the families and nearly  45 per cent fell in the unskilled class alone. Only  4 2,061 cent were professional, the same  proportion were proprietary, and approximately 8  per cent were clerical and kindred workers. For  the purpose of the survey of it was not essential to secure a cross-section of Harlem in regard to social class distribution. However, the above proportions are probably fairly indicative of the total Harlem situation in this respect.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In Table I and in the accompanying chart the percentages of families of designated income groups are given for all families and for each occupational class. In 1929 less than a quarter of all families earned less than $1,200 In 1932 approximately 60 per cent earned less than this amount. Families receiving less than $600 numbered about 4 per cent in 1929 and 24 per cent in 1932 During this time the median family income fell from $1,808 to $1,019 [ <a href="#****"><b>4</b></a> ] a decline of about 44 per cent. (See Table 2.)<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Even in 1929 the median family income of the unskilled laborers was approximately only $1,600. In 1932 the median for families of this class fell to $907. This means that 50 per cent of these families had incomes of less than $75 per month. In fact, slightly more than one quarter of them had incomes of less than $50 per month. At this point, it should be mentioned that in cases in which "doubling up" occurred, the total income for all in the household was used in the computation. Usually those who "moved in" came without a job, so the per capita income would probably indicate an even bleaker picture.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The skilled workers suffered a somewhat greater proportionate decrease in family income than any other class. The median changed from $1,955 in 1929 to $1,003 in 1932 a decline of almost 50 per cent. The white skilled workers in the Brooklyn area studied also underwent a somewhat greater proportionate drop in income than any other social class represented in the survey of that area. This situation is doubtless due to the special inactivity of building trades and other industries requiring skilled workers.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Among the relatively small white-collar groups the income decreases were 35 per cent in the professional class, 44 per cent in the proprietary class and 37 per cent among clerical and kindred workers. In this group the highest 1929 median family income was $2,250 among the proprietors. In 1932 the professional class showed the highest median income and this amounted to only $1,440 or $120 per month.<p>

<a name="10"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> It would be naive indeed to claim complete accuracy of findings. In individual cases there were certainly errors in statement of occupation. Equally certain it is that family earnings cannot be accounted for to the last cent or dollar during the four years under consideration. Individual errors doubtless arise through faulty memory or deliberate misstatement on the part of the informant or through mistakes on the part of the enumerator. There may be those who will argue that such errors are likely to be greater when the informants or the enumerators, or both, are Negroes. In reply to such an argument we can say that the broad outlines of the findings in the Harlem survey are similar to those of white communities canvassed by whites. Again, we can say that it was a frequent observation in our office that the Negro enumerators, as a group, were more competent than the whites used in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Furthermore, the logical consistency of the various aspects of the Harlem data is very encouraging.<p>

<a name="11"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Further significance of the declines in family income in Harlem may be seen by comparison with changes in the cost of living during the same period. It is impossible to secure a cost of living index for Harlem, but the figures for the total New York wage-earners and low-salaried families, published by the United States Bureau of Labor, should suffice for suggestive trends. Although the family incomes for the total group studied in Harlem declined approximately 44 per cent from 1929 to 7932, the New York cost of living index declined only 17 per cent from June, 1929 to June, 1932 Further, more recent cost of living indices issued by the Bureau of Labor have indicated an increase of about a per cent from the "low" of June, 1933 to November, 1934. [ <a href="#*5"><b>5</b></a> ] It is extremely doubtful that there was a corresponding increase in income of Harlem families during the latter period.<p>

<a name="12"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> There are, of course, other deeply embedded causes of tension in Harlem, such as high rentals, resentment against discrimination, and dissatisfaction with the relief situation. Probably none of these, however, is of as much importance as family income itself. Responsibility for the recent outbreak in Harlem may justly be laid at the door of the "red element" if-by that term we mean the color of entries in household account books.<p>

<a name="*"><B>1</B></a> From the Milbank Memorial Fund.<p>

<a name="**"><B>2</B></a> Households having married individuals other than the  head and/or wife of the primary family were treated as a single  family and assigned to the occupational class of the husband  in the primary family. A household was not included in the  survey if no member of it had ever been married. The main  reason for such omissions was that these households could not  be used in the fertility analysis. However, it is not unfortunate  that such households were excluded from the point of view of  this income analysis. Much difficulty would have been  encountered in classifying such households by social class. The  complication of frequently changing constituency of such  households would also have been met.

<a name="***"><B>3</B></a> The assignment of families to these classes was not done  by the field enumerators. These workers simply reported  usual or last specific occupations and industry of the husbands.  A slightly modified form of the 1920 United States Census  occupational code was used in the office for routine division of the families into the above social-economic classes.<p>

It is interesting to note the chief constituent occupations represented in the Harlem survey.<p>

  Professional: Approximately one-half were musicians and one-fifth were ministers. The remaining few were physicians lawyers, dentists, teachers, etc.<p>

  Proprietary: Real estate and renting agents comprised one-quarter of this group. Undertakers accounted for one-eighth. The remaining were largely keepers of small stores, stands, and shops.<p>

  Clerical: Composed largely of petty clerks and workers of a kindred nature, such as shipping clerks, baggage checkers, yard clerks, agents, and letter carriers. Actors and showmen were assigned to this class and they constituted approximately one-fifth of it.<p>

  Skilled workers: Cooks, painters (including glaziers and varnishers), carpenters, mechanics, etc.<p>

  Semi-skilled: Truck drivers, waiters, operatives in clothing factories and laundries, etc.<p>

  Unskilled: Porters, general laborers, elevator tenders, longshoremen, servants, janitors, garage laborers. boiler tenders, etc.  <p>
