<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> BEFORE this article appears the President's  much-discussed Work-Relief Bill may have  reached a compromise satisfactory enough  at least to insure its passing through a  faction-torn Congress. This will not,  however, put an end to the vital interest  with which Negroes, in common with all  workers, should scrutinize the provisions of  the bill. Assuming that the President is  sincere in his announced intention of taking  this country "out of the business of relief,"  then the manner of his so doing will  certainly concern very deeply the  dark-skinned workers who form more than  one-fifth of the nation's jobless.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Dismay is the first reaction which thoughtful  Negroes will register toward this program-not  so much because of what it plans, but because of  what it fails to plan. At first and hasty thought it  is pleasant to think of $4,880,000,000 set aside  for a gigantic nation-wide public works program.  It is cheering to think of heads of families lining  up for jobs instead of relief checks. So pleasantly  cheering is the prospect that already state  legislatures and officials are mistaking the plan  for the deed, and are considering the early  possibility of cutting down their appropriations  and personnel for local relief. Relief supervisors  and administrators are even now concocting dire  punishments for future slackers who may show a  disposition to remain on relief rather than accept  public works jobs.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> This optimism is premature, just as was true in  the cases of NRA, CWA, and others of the  Administration's pet schemes for "priming the  industrial pump of America." Certainly the  controversy which the Work-Relief Bin is  evoking at present writing in Senate committee  and corridors indicates that there are grave  weaknesses in the plans of President Roosevelt  for ending the dole by giving jobs. Outstanding  among these weaknesses is the President's  insistence that the rate of pay shall be lower than  prevailing wage levels. Here he has met the  bitter opposition of organized labor, and it seems  that he will meet defeat on the issue.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> There should be no hesitation among the  Negroes to back up the position which organized  labor takes in this instance. Mr. Roosevelt's plan to pay a lower wage than private industry is  nothing less than an attempt to lower the existing  wage level throughout all industry. It is a surrender to those interests which claim that  "recovery" is held back because the wage  structure is too high. It is an ignoral of the plain  fact that in the building trades the wages for  workers have taken a considerable drop in the  past two years while the costs of materials have  gone steeply upward.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Secondly, Negroes must entertain serious  doubts regarding their chances of getting a fair  proportion of jobs if and when the Work-Relief  program goes into effect. We have received no  assurance thus far that methods for assigning  jobs will be any different from those established  in CWA and PWA. Our experience with these  two agencies has been bitter in the extreme. It is  not enough to say that jobs will be given to  workers taken from the relief rolls; we require  assurance at this time that jobs, skilled and  unskilled, shall be given out on a basis of need,  with no discrimination on account of race. <p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Finally, even the gigantic sum of  $4,000,000,000 has its limits, in spite of the blithe  predictions of the cheery Mr. Roosevelt.  Whether 4,000,000 workers are placed at  prevailing rates of pay or 8,000,000 are placed at  lower than prevailing rates of pay, this will not  take care of all the unemployed. Neither can  4,000,000 jobs be started all at once. While  looking forward hopefully to the prospect of jobs  which will take our unemployed off the relief  rolls, we must be on guard to see that present  relief appropriations will take care of their needs  until employed. There has been too much talk of  taking the country "out of the business of relief,"  with too little attention paid to insuring adequate  care for those who must remain on relief through  no fault of their own. Through bitter experience  Negroes have learned that where the  unemployed suffer, our own racial sufferings are  doubled and tripled in proportion to our numbers.  We have learned that where the drop in wage  levels brings the worker perilously close to the  level of bare existence, the Negro worker is  brought even below this existence level.<p>
