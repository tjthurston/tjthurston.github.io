<h3>Housing</h3><p>
<ol>
<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> IN this issue of OPPORTUNITY, Helen Alfred, distinguished authority on Housing, writes briefly on the subject of better housing as a part of the Recovery Program. We hope that it will stimulate those who are interested in the welfare of the Negro to redouble their efforts to secure slum clearance and low cost housing in those sections of our large cities occupied by Negroes.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> With the exception of Indianapolis, Cleveland, Atlanta and Detroit, there has been a noticeable lack of intelligently directed effort to secure the benefits of improved housing in the congested, and often neglected Negro areas of our cities. One of the difficulties has undoubtedly been the inability to create financially responsible agencies able to acquire the necessary equity in the land to qualify for governmental loans.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Happily this difficulty has been eliminated by the action of Secretary of the Interior Harold- L. Ickes. Now it is possible for qualified public authority to secure an outright grant from the government of 30 per cent of the cost of labor and materials and a long time loan of the remaining 70 per cent for the erection of low cost dwellings. By this generous act of the national administration it would appear that the greatest obstacle to better housing has been removed. And it is up to all of those interested in the Negro to bend every effort to secure the eradication of the unsightly, unhealthy slums that now disfigure our cities, and the erection in their stead of sanitary, low cost housing. Nothing certainly is more needed by the Negro in the urban centers of the nation, and nothing will contribute more to a reduction of his frightful death rate, juvenile delinquency and crime, much of which can be directly traced to bad housing.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In New York the legislature is being asked to create a City Housing Authority which will give the city itself the opportunity to take full advantage of the offer of the Federal Government. The Housing Authority Bill should certainly receive the endorsement and support of Harlem's not insignificant Negro population and the legislators who are its representatives. <p>

<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In every urban or rural community throughout the United States today conditions of housing exist which are a menace to the health, safety, and morals of large sections of the population. From the Cotton Belt to Canada, and from the Atlantic through every State to the Pacific, there are to be observed thoroughly worn-out dwellings which are the shame of any community in which they stand.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The quality of housing in the slums of our larger cities is well known. It is scarcely necessary to describe at any length the filth, the dark halls, the inconvenient and gloomy rooms, and the stuffy smell of antiquated tenements in the congested and unsanitary areas which are to be found in every section of New York City. Perhaps it is through long association with the conditions of life in run-down neighborhoods that we have become insensitive to their implications. We read the studies of crime commissions and the reports of our Health, Fire, and Tenement House Departments, all of which point to the close correlation between housing and the health and conduct of the people. And yet there is the inclination to feel surprised, perhaps, as we read the opinion of Barry Parker, the British housing expert. With regard to conditions in New York City, Mr. Parker has written:<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "The duty has devolved upon me to know Portuguese and Brazilian slums as few know them. I also know the notorious slums of Dublin and Liverpool. I have spent many midnights and other hours in the slums of Edinburgh with those who well know all their intricacies and ramifications. I have been taken to the worst slums in Berlin. I know Italian, French, Belgian, Dutch and Norwegian slums and the conditions of life in any slum I have ever seen are better than they are in the slums of New York."<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In a great metropolitan center like New York, with its heavy pressure of population and overtaxed facilities, every economic and social problem assumes extravagant proportions. But the housing problem in other cities differs only in extent.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Recognizing the social importance of housing to all the people, and the value of a home construction program as a medium of reemployment in a great key industry, the Federal government has taken a hand. The removal of blighted areas and rehousing of the lower-income groups at rents which they can afford to pay has not been accomplished by speculative builders or limited dividend corporations. This new policy of the Federal government, as expressed in the terms of the National Industrial Recovery Act, presents an opportunity to make rapid progress toward the solution of our housing problem. In conformity with the provisions of the Act, the Government has made large sums of money available for the purpose of clearing slums and erecting low-rent dwellings. These funds will be advanced in the form of loans and outright grants. Private corporations, including limited dividend companies, can merely obtain loans for their projects. Public agencies, in addition to loans, can obtain subsidies amounting to thirty percent of the cost of labor and materials. The policy of the Government presents an opportunity for a vigorous battle against indecent housing conditions. The Government is doing its part; the next steps must be taken by local communities.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> As stated above, the outright grants will be given only to public bodies. Only five States now have the power to create housing boards or authorities with full power to acquire unhealthy areas, clear slums, and construct and operate dwellings. These States are California, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Enabling legislation is pending in a number of extraordinary sessions of State Legislatures. Bills are in process of preparation in other States and are to be introduced in the regular 1934 sessions. In the State of New York, Governor Lehman has committed himself to vigorous support of the legislation necessary to give the cities of that State power to qualify for grants. Major LaGuardia, New York City's new Mayor, rode to his recent victory at the polls with the aid of campaign promises to do all the things possible to secure the creation of a municipal housing commission for New  York City. Robert D. Kohn, National Director of  Housing, has given the people of many States  reason to believe that they can safely hope to  receive generous financial assistance from the  Federal government as soon as they have  provided themselves with the proper instrument  for using such funds. Civic and welfare groups,  members of the clergy, women's organizations  and progressive labor leaders are uniting to  promote sentiment in their local communities  favorable to the creation of municipal housing  authorities.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Most of the municipal legislation is being  patterned after a bill prepared in New York City  under the supervision of the National Public  Housing Conference. Under the terms of this  bill, it is recommended that a municipal housing  authority be created and that a board be  appointed by the Mayor. This board is to have power to issue its own bonds and to sell them to  the Federal government. It will have placed at its  disposal an effective procedure for acquiring  land by condemnation or purchase, for clearing,  replanning and rebuilding unhealthy and blighted  areas, and finally to manage and operate  dwellings when completed. The Government  loans will be repaid out of the rents collected.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Given generous and  persistent support, there is  reason to believe that  citywide housing plans will  be under way in locations  throughout the country  before many months pass.  Non-profit, low-rent public  housing programs now  appear to be reasonably  certain of development-  housing projects developed  by public authorities, on  publicly owned land, with  the aid of public funds.  When this rehousing  recovery program gets  well under way and local  communities new support it, the first rays of  a new dawn in housing will  be seen to break over the  horizon  <p>

<h2>What Hope For The Rural Negro?</h2> <p>

<h3>By CLARK FOREMAN</h3> <p>

<table align=right bgcolor="#cccccc" width=250 height=150 cellpadding=10>
<td><I>Thousands of uprooted share croppers clog the roads of the South aimlessly wandering from place to place- What is their future ? Dr. Foreman ventures to tell us. <p align=right>

--The Editor</I>
</table>
<ol>
<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> WHEN one considers all the problems of a minority group of about twelve million people, it is hard to say which one is the most important for immediate attack. Civil rights, political status, labor and business, all present situations which call for urgent attention if the Negroes of this country are to prosper and become thoroughly integrated in our national life. But from the point of numbers involved, there is no problem which deserves more attention than that of the Negro farm population.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In 1930 the Census showed 6,697,230 or 56.5 per cent of the Negro population to be rural. Of that 4,690,523, or 39.3 per cent of the entire Negro population, were classified as rural-farm population. Of this number 1,987,839 or 46 per cent of the total number of Negroes over 10 years of age were gainfully employed in Agriculture; 182,018 Negroes owned and operated farms and 700,911 were tenants, 923 were managers and 1,112,510 were farm laborers of one sort or another.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Any program that is intended to reach the masses of the Negro population will undoubtedly have to do something about the Negro farmer. No lengthy research is necessary to know that the living conditions of this group are the worst on the North American continent, and far worse than exist in many European countries which we consider "backward."<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Downtrodden and terrorized into peonage by those who claim that "white supremacy" must be insured by such measures, the majority of the rural Negroes are confined to abject servitude and hopeless poverty. Time and again it has been publicly stated by spokesmen of the exploiting land-owners that the only way to treat a Negro is to work him as hard as possible and give him just enough to live on. The economic advantage to the landowner of such a precept is only too obvious. When the prosperity of a group is considered to be dependent on the maintenance of serf labor, the hostility of that group to political rights, education, law and order can be understood.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Once having understood the motives which influence the oppressing group, those who are interested in the continued progress of our Negro population should develop a strategy for releasing the rural Negro from his serfdom. Strategy, to be effective, must be realistic, motivated by sentiment possibly, but based on observable facts.

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Any one familiar with the facts will hardly deny that the rural Negro, deprived of effective political power and subjected to taxation and farm assessments by agents over whom he has no control or influence, can expect little relief from his own efforts so long as the local government is left in complete control of the situation.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> It is generally true that the greater the area of government, the less it will be influenced by local prejudices. It is certainly true that Negroes have received their fairest treatment from the Federal government. Now that the theory of laissez-faire is being buried alongside of the economic depression, and the Federal government is assuming the responsibility for the welfare of the citizenry, there is every reason to hope that the Federal authority will succeed in finding some way of rescuing the rural Negro.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Efforts to this end need not be, and indeed should not be special Negro undertakings. The white tenant-farmer in many places is almost as badly off as the Negroes. But every attempt to improve the agricultural situation in this country should result in benefits for the rural Negro. Whatever steps the Federal government takes in the direction of greater Federal control over agriculture should be welcomed by Negroes.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The first important effort of the government toward improving rural conditions was the crop curtailment scheme which was followed in the South by the government offer to loan money on cotton at ten cents a pound.<p>

<a name="10"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> At the same time the Division of Subsistence Homesteads in the Department of the Interior has been planning for experiments in a new kind of rural life. Under the leadership of Dr. M. L. Wilson this Division is working out varied schemes to change the character of our rural slums. It is hoped that a method will be evolved for taking care of our stranded populations both in the cities and in the country. The government will buy the land, build the houses and equip the farm and the homesteaders will pay back the money over a long period of years.<p>

<a name="11"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Wherever a subsistence homesteads community is founded near a town or city it will be an asset. Therefore it has been urged that some be near Negro-controlled towns. This would be a boon to the Negro merchants in the towns, but it does not mean that only Negroes would be admitted into the homesteads community any more than into the towns, several of which already have mixed populations. The most important benefit of all would be the fact that the Federal government would be behind the people of these communities and would therefore inevitably assume the responsibility for fair play in them.<p>

<a name="12"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Already several of the subsistence homesteads projects call for mixed population on a perfectly fair and equal basis. It is the plan to give the homesteaders a real "New Deal" and those who get in, both colored and white, will be very lucky. There may be some projects in which there will be no Negroes and others in which there will be no whites, but there are lots of towns in the country in which there are no Negroes and some in which there are no white people. The principle usually adopted by the Subsistence Homesteads Division is to leave to the applying group the constituency of the particular project. This gives the same protection to Negro groups that it does to white groups and leaves them both free to admit members of other races that fulfill the qualifications of membership.<p>

<a name="13"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> From the point of view of strategy, the subsistence homesteads should be welcomed by all who aspire to help the large basic group of Negroes. It is a step that may lead the government more and more into the field, and every advance is sure to improve their status. By encouraging the government in these efforts, and at the same time insisting on fair treatment for all, we can be most effective in raising the economic and social standing of the whole Negro race.<p>

<a name="14"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Recently President Roosevelt has gone even further and declared that the government will give relief to the "distressed families in rural areas." It is apparent that such a program on the part of the Federal government will be enormously important to both races.<p>

<a name="15"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> This is such a crucial step on the part of the government and of such particular importance to Negroes that I think it would be well to give the new program in the President's own words. The following is taken from his statement on February 28:<p>

<a name="16"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "The care of needy persons in rural areas is a problem quite distinct and apart from that of the industrial unemployed. Their security must be identified with agriculture. They must be placed in positions of self-support. In many parts of the country this calls for a change from commercial farming and dependence upon a single cash crop, to the raising of the various commodities needed to maintain the families.<p>

<a name="17"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "Relief funds, therefore, will be expended on behalf of rural families in a manner and to an extent that will enable them to achieve self support. Work for wages from relief funds is not an essential part of this phase of the program and will be provided only in so far as it is necessary to accomplish the primary objective. No encouragement of an extension of competitive farming is contemplated, but rather the placing of thousands of persons, who have made their living from agriculture, into a relationship with the soil that will provide them a security they do not now enjoy.<p>

<a name="18"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "Some of the methods to be employed include building or rebuilding to provide adequate farm homes; the provision of seed and of stocks for other than commercial purposes, and opportunity ties to these workers to earn modest cash incomes through part-time or seasonal employment in small industrial enterprises. There should also be a planned distribution of the regular jobs on highways, in the national and state parks and forests and other public work prosecuted in agricultural communities.<p>

<a name="19"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "The plans call for complete cooperation with the Department of Agriculture and with the State and county agricultural departments throughout the country. They substitute for direct relief an opportunity to obtain and maintain self-support in an accustomed environment and completely divorce relief activities in rural areas from those in the cities.<p>

<a name="20"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "Only a careful survey can determine the number of families included in 'stranded populations' but there are sufficient data already collected to indicate a situation of substantial proportions. The solution of the problem of these families involves their physical transplanting, in a large majority of cases, since the areas in which they are concentrated offer neither future employment at wages nor opportunities for self support through agriculture.<p>

<a name="21"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "It is planned to explore this difficult situation and, in collaboration with the Subsistence Homesteads Division of the Department of the Interior, and with other Federal and local agencies, devise and apply definitely remedial measures which will affect an appreciable number of these families.<p>

<a name="22"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "These measures will be directed first at maintenance on small tracts of land and then at the development of supplemental or industrial opportunities to provide for a normal standard of living." . . .<p>

<a name="23"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The President's announcement has been vigorously followed up in the office of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. There, Colonel Laurence Westbrook, with the collaboration of Forrester Washington, is working out plans and programs that are revolutionary in their potential effect on the rural Negro population. At the same time, the addition of John P. Murchison to the staff of the Subsistence Homesteads Division shows that in that office, too, every effort will be made to carry out the President's plan in full.<p>

<a name="24"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> What a year ago seemed an absolutely hopeless situation now appears as one of the most challenging problems of the "New Deal." Negroes on the farm and Negroes in the slums will realize with delight that the lessons we learned from the "crazy decade" have not been in vain. <p>


<h2>The TVA and the Race Problem</h2><p>

<h3>BY CRANSTON CLAYTON</h3><p>

<table align=right bgcolor="#cccccc" width=250 height=150 cellpadding=10><td><I>A white Southerner herein accuses the Federal Government of almost criminal neglect of the Negro in the plans of the Tennessee Valley Administration.<p align=right>

--The Editor.</I></table><p>

<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> IN the 40,000 square miles of the Tennessee Valley lying in parts of seven different states are some two million people divided between white and colored according to the ratio roughly of three to, one. Negroes are relatively thick in northern Alabama and west Tennessee but are correspondingly scarce in the mountains of Virginia, North Carolina, and east Tennessee.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The various maladjustments that have existed in the relationship between these two groups since the beginning of the nation has no doubt been the greatest single factor in causing this region, with all its wealth of coal, phosphates and other minerals, with its diversified and abundant plant life, with its climatic advantages, and with its streams and rivers ready to generate an estimated 3,000,000 horse power of energy, to be even at this late day one of the most backward sections, educationally and industriously, of any in the nation. Now the Tennessee Valley Authority comes into this region not merely to build a series of dams and transmission lines, but to "provide for the agricultural and industrial development of said valley" and to foster "an orderly and physical, economic and social development of such areas." How does the TVA with such broad and profound responsibilities propose to deal with the problem of race relations?<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> AS a relief measure or job providing agency, which it really does not purport to be, the TVA has dealt with the Negro more justly than possibly any other one of the New Deal Acts. Certainly more than the NRA for example, which in most cases in the South has either not been applied at all to Negroes or else has simply been the occasion to throw them completely out of work. TVA authorities claim, and I have no facts with which to dispute such claims, that they are employing Negroes according to their proportion of the total population and in all cases are paying them the same wages that whites receive for doing the same work. In the building of the Joe Wheeler Dam, for example, that more than a mile-long structure being erected fifteen and a half miles above Muscle Shoals, the 523 men now employed are, according to the TVA Personnel Division, divided between the races according to their proportionate population in the territory from which the labor is being drawn. The wage scale of 45c. for unskilled and $1.00 for skilled labor is, according to the same authority, being applied to all regardless of color. Likewise in the Norris project, twenty miles northwest of Knoxville, among the total number of workers now on the payroll some 7 per cent are Negroes which is about their proportion of the population in the twelve counties surrounding Norris.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> However, this equitable representation of Negro laborers at Norris is a story in itself. When the civil service examinations were first given by the TVA in the twelve counties round about Norris, only 1.9 per cent of those who qualified for jobs were Negroes.In these same twelve counties Negroes comprise exactly 7.1 per cent of the total population. Thus it looked as though colored labor was to suffer. TVA authorities insisted that they were helpless to rectify matters since they were compelled to choose their employees from among the people who had qualified by examination. Negro leaders claimed, however, that the reason so small a proportion of their population had qualified was that they had either not even been told of the examinations or else had been given to understand by the native whites that there was no need for them to apply since the whole project was for the advantage of the white man. There were some facts which lent credibility to this charge. For example, TVA authorities did not, and still do not, plan to use any Negro labor on the building of the Norris Dam itself. They claim that building separate dormitories and accommodations for the few Negro laborers representing the small Negro population around Norris would be so expensive as to materially advance the price of the electric power to be sold by the TVA and would thereby prevent the providing of a true "yardstick" to be used on public utilities throughout the nation. Another such fact is that on or about December 1, 1933 a committee of Negro citizens making investigations in the interest of their race claimed to have discovered that only two  Negroes were employed by the TVA in the whole section of twelve counties around Norris. Thus it did seem that there had been no use for the few Negroes who had registered to have gone to that trouble.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> However, TVA leaders, on having this injustice pointed out to them, set about rectifying matters insofar as the limits of the number of  5, Negroes would permit. The event, though, which made possible an equitable division of labor between the races was the allotting on December 5, 1933 of $3,343,402 by the Civil Works Administration to be spent by the TVA. With this money the TVA could hire laborers from the relief rolls of various counties without their being qualified by examination and could pay them regular TVA wages. This was a godsend to Negroes. This CWA money, to be sure, may be discontinued, but Dr. Floyd W. Reeves, Head of the Personnel Division of the TVA, authorizes the author of this article to say that "if and when TVA-CWA funds are no longer available arrangements are being made to employ Negroes in the task of clearing the reservoir space to be flooded by the Norris Dam in numbers great enough to insure a proportion commensurate with their part of the population." This work, according to Dr. Reeves, will last for some two years.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In the long-range program of social planning Negroes are not definitely promised to fare so well.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> To be sure, certain general aims of the Valley Development will, if realized, prove advantageous to them along with the rest of the population. They will be able to buy cheaper fertilizer and electrical power. Their farms, too, may suffer less from soil erosion after a program of reforestation has been put through.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> But if Norris is prophetic of the total training program of the Development then Negroes have little cause to be thankful to their Uncle Sam. At Norris will be established a working experiment in coordination between industry and agriculture, the ideal which the TVA envisions for the whole Tennessee Valley. The natives of this cooperative community will receive extensive training in the arts, trades, and skills essential to such a mode of living. That they may become expert in agriculture, for instance, they will be provided a farm-garden for demonstration, a model poultry plant, and a dairy farm with pasteurizing plant connected. Men will also be taught skill in woodwork and in metal work. The women will receive courses in home planning and management. All homes will be electrified for providing lights and heat. Roads will be kept free from sign-boards, hot-dog stands, and road-side clutter. From all this the Negro, as desperately as he needs training, is to be absolutely excluded. He can not even live on the outskirts of the town in his customary hovel.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> This is a bitter blow to Negro leadership. Southern states, as niggardly as they may be, do at least provide some sort of educational facilities for the blacks. And southern towns will at least allow their out-caste population to live in dirt and shacks down by the creek or the railroad track. But the government does worse. It absolutely excludes them.<p>

<a name="10"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> This blow is all the more disheartening because it is delivered by the United States government. The Negro looks to the government as his best if not his only friend. This is due partly to the method by which he was emancipated. It is due also to the fact that Federal Courts have been about the only agency by which Negroes felt they could protect themselves as American citizens. Negro leaders had hopes that in this government venture into the South their rights might be championed. Their hopes burned all the brighter because the government seemed to have a relatively free hand to do as it pleased. Norris is built on government property. The project is nationally supported and therefore ought to be somewhat independent of local prejudices. And last of all, since the Tennessee Valley was receiving gratis such a splendid present from the nation, the whites, it is believed, would have more or less willingly made considerable concessions to whatever ideals the government had wanted to put into effect.<p>

<a name="11"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Promises, nebulous and indefinite, are being made Negro groups that other cooperative communities are to be established in which their rights will be taken care of. It is hoped, not without some assurance, that such a community may be established near Huntsville, Alabama, in connection with the state supported Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes. This would be all the more practicable since one service of such a community is to provide a field for student labor for cooperative colleges which proceed according to a work-study program.<p>

<a name="12"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> It is possibly wise for the government to take a lesson from its mistakes in Reconstruction Days when, for the good of all concerned, it forced the matter of Negro rights too rapidly. However, we have come a long way since 1865 Since that far away time it has begun to dawn even on the Southern white man that, educationally, economically, industrially, and morally, Booker T. Washington was right when he said that "the only way to hold the Negro down in the ditch is to stay down in the ditch with him." If the government is to help any of us, it will have to help all of us <p>


<h2>Negro Workers and Recovery</h2><p>
<h3>
By Lester B. Granger</h3><p>
<ol>
<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> NEGRO labor in St. Louis, MO., has shown the way for colored workers throughout the country to make an aggressive attack against prejudiced and discriminatory policies on the part of certain sections of the American labor movement. <p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> For many months in the midst of the depression, Negroes saw all municipal work in building trades turned over to white union workers who steadfastly refused to allow a Negro mechanic to work with them. In the 17 Negro schools of the city, no Negro was allowed to earn a single dime on building or repair work. Representation to and conferences with city and union officials brought only evasive rejoinders and no action. Finally, the Negroes' patience snapped at sight of a $2,000,000 colored hospital being erected in the middle of their own neighborhood, built with municipal and Federal funds, with no Negro carpenters, bricklayers, painters, or other skilled workers, allowed on the job.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Out of this resentment, guided and advised by the St. Louis Urban League, grew a Negro labor organization of building trades workers whose avowed aim was to protect the interests of Negro workers under the recovery program.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The new organization, the International Laborers and Builders Corporation, includes bricklayers, painters, decorators and paper-hangers, carpenters, plasterers, electricians, cement finishers and hod-canters, and laborers, with membership well over 300. Its efforts have met with instant results. Contractors formerly indifferent now show a disposition to employ Negro labor which is organized. And, most significant of all, A. F. of L. unions are taking a deep concern in the plans and activities of this new organization of Negro workers.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> A sharp and dramatic appeal for organization of the 5,000,000 Negro workers in the United States, employed and unemployed, has been issued by T. Arnold Hill, acting executive secretary of the National Urban League.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In an open letter to Negro workers, the League head urges the organization of Workers' Councils in every city of the United States where Negroes are refused equal rights with whites to find work and to join labor unions.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "For sixty-eight years," the statement declares, "the Negro worker has been appealing to American Labor for a "New Deal" in its treatment of black labor. These efforts have met either with limited, half-hearted success or with dismal failure, the only exceptions being in those fields where Negroes have banded together to demand the rights that were theirs.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "For fourteen months we have been witnessing in the United States an unprecedented effort at economic stabilization. The cause of labor is riding 'high, wide, and handsome.' Yet the cause of Negro workers has not been one of labor's aims. Appeals in your behalf have fallen far short of the desired goal. The position of Negro workers will be strengthened only if they, themselves, realize the necessity for action. You must organize to break down the discriminatory barriers that keep you out of unions and consequently out of employment. You must organize to demand a new deal for Negro labor.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "The National Urban League is, therefore, initiating the establishment of Workers' Councils as active aggressive units through which all Negro workers may obtain union recognition, increase their power for collective action and equal pay, and participate in the improvement of the status of all workers-white and black."<p>

<h2>The Subsistence Homesteads Experiment and the Negro</h2><p>

<h3>By JOHN P. MURCHISON</h3><p>

<table align=right bgcolor="#cccccc" width=250 height=100 cellpadding=10><td><I>Professor Murchison herein explains the proposed Subsistence Homesteads Experiments as they affect the Negro.<p align=right>

--The Editor</I></table><p>
<ol>
<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> EVER since the Division of the Subsistence Homesteads was established by the present administration it has been understood by many Negroes to be a "back-to-the-farm" movement, and consequently, they have been rather wary about it. The Subsistence Homesteads program embraces no such movement. Its purpose is to create social experiment stations that will point the way in the decentralization of our over-populated urban centers and in the creation of a new way of life for low income workers, urban and rural.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> A "back - to - the - farm" movement implies sending men back to the same remote country places that they have abandoned; making them eke out a meagre living as best they can on eroded or submarginal land. The present movement, in the first place, aims to establish homesteads, not farms. On his homestead, the homesteader will have a garden, not a farm; that is, he will pro-produce for his own needs and not for the market. It is not intended that the homesteaders should compete with any of the commercial farms. The present experiment will connote farming only in the sense that the homesteader will raise enough for his family's needs; in no sense will he become the primitive farmer relying entirely upon a farm for his livelihood. Since his pro-production will be for home consumption only, it is therefore necessary that he have some other definite source of cash income. The homestead community will be located either near the business or industrial district, or in localities into which industry has been decentralized, thereby making it possible for the homesteader to obtain economic security through the combination of part-time gardening with part-time industrial labor. There is no difficulty in combining the two, especially with the short hour codes that are now in effect, and the necessity for "spread-"spreading" work. Secondly, this experiment cannot be termed a "back-to-the-farm" movement because it would be impractical to require even those under the sternest economic pressure to move away from the city, abandoning the cultural and educational opportunities of the city and town life. Where homesteads are located on the outskirts of large cities, community and recreational centers either will be accessible or easily provided.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The question may arise now as to what is to be done with the present farmer or rural worker, whether or not he can remain on his farm and still combine it with part-time industrial labor. Since the farmers who are on relief are those on worn out and eroded land, the government intends to move them away from this useless land and place them where they can be self-supporting. The submarginal land that cannot be used for farming will be used, to some extent, for forests and pasture land. There is hope that some for the further decentralization of industry, which still is definitely being considered by many industrial captains.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Such social experiment stations as are provided by the Subsistence Homesteads Experiment are needed because they offer permanent relief, not present emergency relief. Past and present experiences have proven that a program of permanent relief is needed. Past experience has proven that it is difficult to make an adequate living on the farm, and hence, there was a movement to the city up until 1929 But it was found that the city was no more economically secure than the country; so from 1930 Up to the present, there has been a trend back to the country. However, this movement, for the most part, has been unguided and has done little to better conditions. Therefore, the Subsistence Homesteads Division is organized primarily to guide these people and to give them definite means by which to raise their economic status. In doing this it can be seen that the Division is not creating anything new but rather is trying to guide a movement that already has begun. Instead of letting these migrants wander about aimlessly, the Division intends to locate them near industrial centers where it will be possible for them to stay permanently.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The Negro, because of his weak economic position, needs these homesteads more than any other group; he needs them because his status, both industrially and agriculturally, is more precarious. Industrially, the Negro has suffered mostly because he is, as a rule, unskilled and unorganized. On account of this, he has been forced to work for the lowest of wages. Even when he has had the same type of work as the white man his salary generally has been lower. Furthermore, he has had to depend entirely upon his low salary for all his needs. It is no wonder that we find him living generally under unsanitary conditions in the tenements and slums of the cities.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Agriculturally, he has suffered generally because of the traditional discrimination that confronts him almost everywhere in the rural South and because of his weak marketing position. Recently he met with another hazard which resulted from the efforts of the AAA to tighten the cotton belt. Where crop reductions have been required in these sections in which Negroes have worked as sharecroppers, generally it has resulted in these workers being expelled from the soil. In other sections, moreover, farm labor is no longer looked upon as Negro work, because the depression has driven so many whites to perform this work.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The above are among the main reasons why the Negro of the low-income strata should participate in the homesteads experiment and thus try to find a clue to civilization through experimentation a different scale of values from those he following at the present. The Subsistence Homesteads demonstrations can point the way in changing his mode of living altogether. Instead of depending solely upon either his pay envelope or his share as a farm hand he will be able to obtain a higher standard of living. through the combination of both of these, and through the purchasing of his home at virtually cost with small monthly payments. Since it has been proven that he can raise at least 73 per cent of his food in his garden he will be able to use his leisure time creatively and his earnings from industry for other needs than food. He will be in no danger of being wholly supplanted by white labor because industry would break faith with the government whenever it curtailed the opportunity of the homesteader to pay his Federal loan. He thus in time will become full owner of his homestead, and these homesteads will be no shacks and hovels, no slums and tenements; instead, they will be modern dwellings, fully equipped and with enough land to carry on all the activities of a homestead.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> This, furthermore, is a public experiment where segregation and discrimination are not contemplated. The question of the racial makeup of the units is treated from the point of view of problem-areas; that is, mixed units are established in the areas where mixed groups at present are living; and unmixed units in problem areas that at the present are made up exclusively of one race. It is also intended that the leadership and management of all the projects will be predominantly in the hands of the majority group in the particular unit, regardless of race, creed or color. This will provide an opportunity for Negro leadership in those units where Negroes are the exclusive homesteaders and where Negroes are in the majority.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The Negro should seize every fair opportunity to participate in this experiment so that he will not be left out of the new economic structure that now is emerging. His failure to do this will make him in the revised economic order what he has been in the old capitalistic order, an economic outcast and beggar.<p>

<a name="10"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> With its limited appropriation it is impossible for the Division to relieve all the destitute; but enough demonstration projects either have been or will be set up to guide the way for further development along this line when sufficient money is provided to convert the present experiment into a real movement. The Negro should have sufficient representation in the experiment to make it possible for him to go into the movement as an economically experienced group rather than as a group of apprentices. <p>

<h2>The Negro Joins the Picket Line</h2><p>

<h3>By LESTER B. GRANGER</h3><p>

<table align=right bgcolor="#cccccc" width=250 height=100 cellpadding=10><td><I>The real story of the Bridgeton strike and the part played there in by Negroes employed in the farming and canning industry of New Jersey.<p align=right>

--The Editor</I></table>
<ol>
<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "DID we win the strike ? Brother, I don't know, and that's a fact," said Jim Mills. "I know we didn't lose it. We ain't got nothin' now, maybe, but we didn't have nothin' befo'-so how could we lose?"<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> And that in general is the attitude of the rest of the Negro farm and cannery workers of Bridgeton, N. J., strikers and non-strikers, as they take stock of their situation during the aftermath of Bridgeton's hectic farm strike. Using the phraseology of striker Jim, "they didn't have nothing and it looked like they wouldn't never get nothin', so why not strike and take a chance of gettin' somethin'."<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The result was the Bridgeton strike, a dramatic walk-out and more dramatic picketing by 300 white and Negro employees of the 5000-acre Seabrook Farm. The strike broke upon the metropolitan area with astounding unexpectedness; it tied up New Jersey's largest farming section for a thrilling two weeks, it cost the farm owners a crop loss of $100,000 it set Negro and white women and men battling shoulder to shoulder against police and sheriff's deputies armed with shot guns, clubs and tear gas bombs.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Such events seemed almost unbelievable to those who knew Bridgeton as the quiet and picturesque county seat of Cumberland County. Tourists from Wilmington to Atlantic City remembered the town as a prosperous community of 20,000, surrounded by rich farms and presenting wide, shaded streets and attractive homes to the passing motorists. They have admired the thriving truck gardens, stopped at comfortable Cumberland Hotel, and driven on again, faintly envying the residents who lived so pleasantly in the midst of rural plenty.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Many Negroes know Bridgeton, also, for they have read of historical Gouldtown with its thrifty group of colored small farmers, descend-ants of pre-Revolutionary settlers. They have visited the town for week-ends to picnic in the attractive groves and to bathe in the countless swimming holes which the adjacent river and ponds afford. They have heard that Bridgeton colored folk are "backward"-that they live in terrible houses, that they are content to work for three and four dollars a week, that no colored physician has been able to make a living from the 2000 Negroes resident in town and country nearby.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Bridgeton lives twenty years behind the times. Even the Ku Klux Klan is still active hereabout. The knights of the hooded sheet own meeting groves and gather for "konklaves" and burn crosses for the mystification of a bucolic audience. The entire county is controlled industrially, politically and socially by a small group of cannery class factory and farm owners of which last class Charles F. Seabrook is one.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The geographical visage of Bridgeton is pleasant to see, with its old-fashioned homes of cordial architecture and its wide-shaded streets, but the social soul of the town is not so pretty. That soul may be found by turning off the main streets into the back alleys where live the workers in canneries, in homes and on farms. At first sight these neighborhoods give . a shock. Half-clothed, half-starved, completely dirty children, poor white and Negro, run about in hopelessly squalid surroundings. Frowsy heads look out from half-open doors, through which may be seen badly ventilated rooms crowded with broken furniture and with broken humanity.<p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The visitor stops at a door; a starved mongrel dog rises with a snarl and limps away. A family of six is seated around a kitchen table which is scarcely more appalling in its unappetizing disarray than the unkempt diners. In the front room a sick lad, half-clothed, lies on a pallet and looks up with lack-luster eyes, panting in the stifling heat which pours in from the tree-less, sun-drenched road outside. An acrid odor lingers everywhere-the odor which spells no running water, no toilets, no fit habitation for humans.<p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "Sure!" says the family head. "The water's cut off-been cut off ever since we been here. The roof leaks in all the rooms but this'n. Rent? We pays ten a month.<p>

<a name="10"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "I makes 'bout seven-fifty a week in pickin' time and the boy, he gin'ally make most as much, but he been sickly the las' few weeks. The wife, she do's day's work and she make 'bout three a week, so we mostly gits along some-ways."<p>

<a name="11"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> It was out of situations like this, to be found among Negro and Italian pickers in the fields and workers in the canneries, that the strike idea was born in all defiance of South Jersey public attitudes, in all defiance of Klan threats, in all defiance of the traditional belief that Negroes will not strike and that Negroes and whites cannot organize together successfully.<p>

<a name="12"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The Bridgeton strike was news, dramatic news for the metropolitan dailies which found amazing the spectacle of Negroes actually organizing to strike and to defy the armed might of Cumberland County's police forces. The strike leaped to the front pages of Philadelphia and New York dailies. It forced its way into the offices of Governor Moore, who refused the re-quest that state troopers be sent to put down the disorder, and who replied that he could not interfere to the detriment of men and women who were working for twelve and eighteen cents an hour. The strike took up the time of the state legislature, when a Republican Assembly passed a resolution insisting that state troopers be dispatched, a resolution which was ignored by the Governor. Bridgeton for five days held the spot-light of public attention.<p>

<a name="13"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Meanwhile two hundred and fifty strikers were on the picket line outside the farm gates, determined that scabs should not go in to work the crops and that trucks should not come out to take their loads to market. The presence of town police, sheriff's deputies, and fifty or more volunteer "vigilantes" recruited from white farmers of the section failed to awe the strikers in the least. As trucks attempted to roll out of the grounds, men and women climbed on top and threw the vegetable loads to the ground.<p>

<a name="14"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Police grappled with the raiders, and were themselves attacked by picket reinforcements. Women received, and gave no quarter in the hand-to-hand scuffling. Tear gas bombs were brought into play and the police gained a temporary advantage which enabled them to arrest twenty-seven strikers, about half of them Negroes, and hustle them into Bridgeton to the county jail. This was the story which intrigued the press of three great cities, which focused public attention upon the disgraceful conditions under which men and women work in South Jersey's farms, and which brought Federal and state mediators to the scene to arrange for strike settlement.<p>

<a name="15"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> But behind this story there was the real story, the inside story, of how Jerry Brown, Negro farmhand, together with Dan Hart, Casey Jones, Robert Swigley and Joseph Sicosi, got together to organize white and Negro workers who were toiling in the fields ten hours a day to make a wage of $1.75 at nightfall. There is the story of how Garfield McKee, white professional "organizer" came upon the scene and attempted to take these untutored workers under his wing--how they watched his methods and mastered his scheme of organization, and then when they were ready to go ahead with the serious work of the union, how they quietly pushed him out of the picture and elected their own officers.<p>

<a name="16"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> There is the story of the first strike on April 10th, undramatic but successful, when Jerry Brown as president of the Agricultural and Cannery Workers' Industrial Union, was fired by Seabrook for his organizing activities. Seabrook was forced to deal with Jerry after all, for the workers walked out in a body and named Brown as leader of their committee.<p>

<a name="17"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "Jerry," said Seabrook, "you know we've always been for the colored people. You know we've always hired them on our farms right along with the white folks."<p>

<a name="18"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "Yes," says Jerry, "hired 'em last and fired'em first when slack season comes along."<p>

<a name="19"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "Break up the union," urged Seabrook, "and I'll take care of you. I'll fire all the Dagoes and just keep colored on. I'd rather have colored anyhow."<p>

<a name="20"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> And so on, through all the traditional employer-to-worker arguments. In the long run, the strikers went back to work, not for seventeen and a half cents an hour, but under a new agreement which paid twenty-five cents to women and thirty cents to men. They worked on that basis until June 25th, when notice came to the workers' union that the farm owners simply could not pay such wages and make a profit, and that the rate would be cut to twenty, eighteen, and fifteen cents an hour for men, women, and children<p>

<a name="21"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Moreover, the workers found that another agreement was being violated. It had been the Seabrook custom, during slack season, to lay off most of his Negro help and to keep on the white workers. This, in conference with the union, he had promised not to do, but to keep on workers without regard to race. The June lay-off, however, found 125 workers dropped, with nearly all of them Negroes The lay-off and the wage cut roused the workers' indignation afresh, and second strike was called.<p>

<a name="22"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Meanwhile the union's leadership had changed. Jerry Brown had been deposed as president; Clarence Cain as president and Clifford Whiteas vice-president formed a new white-Negro leadership. Reasons given for the change vary. Some say that Brown had lost some of his militancy after Klan crosses had been burned in front of his house, and that he was not protecting the union's interests vigorously. Others scoffed at the idea of pugnacious Jerry being scared off by a burning cross. They told of his public promises to put a shot-gun load into the first Klansman he found on his property. 

<a name="23"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The Brown adherents claim that radical organizers were responsible for the change in leadership, that Donald and Elinor Henderson, Communist organizers in South Jersey, were too active in conduct of union policies and that Brown's thoughtful and conservative judgment was a stumbling block in the Communists' path. At any rate, Brown went out and the Communists came in just at a time when Seabrook tossed the match into the powder barrel. The strike resulted and South Jersey industrial history was made. 

<a name="24"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Bridgeton is quiet in the aftermath of the strike. Some workers are back on the job, following efforts of Federal and local mediators. They are frankly dissatisfied. Most of the picketers have not been re-employed, contrary to the settlement agreement. The arbitration board of "two farmers, two 'representative citizens', and a member appointed by the court" give the strikers no representation. "It's the representative citizens who belong to the Klan and Vigilantes," said one striker. 

<a name="25"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> And yet, there is a feeling of satisfaction among Negroes, strikers and non-strikers, that the demonstration was made, no matter what the immediate results may be. A group sat in the colored Elks Hall and, chairs tilted back against the wall, summed up the situation.

<a name="26"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "The way I look at it is like this," said one, a towering truck driver who resembled Rex Ingram of "Stevedore." "I've been hanging around this town a good while-too damned long. I've never seen a colored man get anything for his work but a beating. He works his head off all day long, and all he's got is enough to eat on. If he don't work, he's no worse off, because the relief won't let him starve anyhow.

<a name="27"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "I say, if we can't get anything for working, let's see what we can get for fighting. This ain't the only town in God's country. If we can't make it here, we'll let these pecks have the town. But we'll make 'em sweat for it first!"<p>

<h2>Negro Workers and Organized Labor </h2><p>

--The Editor. </I></table><p>
<ol>
<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> A LITTLE more than a year ago the National Industrial Recovery Act was passed by the United States Congress. It carried significant implications for all groups of American citizens. For organized labor it created one of the most challenging situations in its history. The devastating lethargy that characterized workers in the mills, shops and mines, due partly to the protracted unemployment and widespread depression, was displaced by a new spirit of collective mindedness. <p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> This awakened consciousness of the New Deal for labor manifested itself in an almost universal spirit of restlessness which was characterized by simultaneous strikes bobbing up in every part of the country. Then appeared large black headlines across the pages of our dailies in every city, village and hamlet, such statements as "Strike Grips Oakland;" "Frisco Reds Are Raided;" "3,ooo Workers Quit in Alabama Cotton Mill Dispute;" "First Truck of Gasoline and Food Brought in Under Heavy Guard." <p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> These labor controversies have enveloped every type of workmen including laundry workers, longshoremen, truck drivers, textile operatives and those employed in the iron and steel industries. <p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Another evidence of a sense of new security on the part of labor has been evidenced by the disposition of the leaders to increase the numerical strength of their various crafts and unions, and the remarkable strides which have been made in this direction. The Federal Union form of organization, which was set up to deal with small local groups not covered by the jurisdiction of any national craft union, seems to appeal to the worker more than the old craft type. More than thirteen hundred such units have been organized since July I, 1933. This is more than five times as many as the total organized five years previous, beginning in 1928. <p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The American Federation of Labor has encountered some difficulties in penetrating the unorganized field of labor. Its leaders have been considered by many as reactionary and it has been regarded by others as the official union of the NRA. Representatives of the United Mine Workers spread propaganda among its members to the effect that John Lewis, head of the Miners' Union, was an undercover representative of President Roosevelt and ate breakfast with him every morning.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The following quotation from the Cleveland Citizen," an organ of the labor movement of that city, indicates the extent of activity among labor: <p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> "The organization of workers has been proceeding so rapidly in Ohio that it is physically impossible for union officials to respond to all the calls for trained men and women to address meetings." <p>

<a name="8"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The Trade Union Unity League, organized by the Communist Party to displace the A. F. of L. as the dominating influence in labor, has had a rapid increase in its members. <p>

<a name="9"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> This new spirit toward collective action has registered in unionized activity in the automobile, clothing, coal, rubber and textile industries as well as in the power and electric equipment enterprises. Representatives of the textile industry claim that more than ~30,ooo workers in various sections of the country have been organized in recent months. They claim that in the South there are some three hundred locals recently organized seventy-four of them in the State of North Carolina. <p>

<a name="10"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Section 7 A' of the National Recovery Act is undoubtedly responsible for the major emphasis in this new awakening that has taken place among the industrial workers in the last twelve months. <p>

<a name="11"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Section 7 A of the National Recovery Act reads as follows:
<blockquote>"Sec. 7. (a) Every code of fair competition, agreement, and license approved, prescribed, or issued under this title shall contain the following conditions: (1) That employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agency, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection; (2) that no employee and no one seeking employment shall be required as a condition of employment to join any company union or to refrain from joining, organizing, or assisting a labor organization of his own choosing; and ( 3 ) that employers shall comply with the maximum hours of labor, minimum rates of pay, and other conditions of employment, approved or prescribed by the President."</blockquote><p>

<a name="12"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> While the American Federation of Labor has been a rallying center for the workers of America for many decades, it is now facing not only a New Deal but a New Day. Labor in the United States is facing the most firmly entrenched and ruthless capitalistic system of the world. Any labor movement that is to survive the transition through which labor is now passing must be so constructed that it can lend itself; to the highly integrated structure of American industry. Already new trends are arising in the rank of labor characterized by unauthorized strikes against the present leadership.<p>

<a name="13"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The formation of what is called an adverse opinion among railroad shop workers toward the American Federation of Labor was crystallized in the establishing recently in Chicago of an organization known as the "Independent Organization of Western Lines." The promoters of this movement repudiate the discriminatory practices of the American Federation of Labor and protest against what is considered abnormally high membership fee. This new labor union essays to welcome all workers regardless of race or section from whence they come.<p>

<a name="14"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Except in a few isolated cases, Negroes are not being included in any considerable numbers either in the controversial aspects of this new birth or by inclusion into peaceful membership of the various labor unions.<p>

<a name="15"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> While Section 7 A has greatly increased the security of labor in general; in so far as the different labor organizations thus benefited deny and exclude Negroes from their membership by constitutions or rituals, the position of Negro labor has been made less favorable. It was the intention of the government in passing this legislation on behalf of labor to benefit all workers. On account of the unsportsmanlike and anti-social attitude of the majority of the membership and heads of many of the unions and crafts, the position of Negroes has been made even more disadvantageous.<p>

<a name="16"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In the City of St. Louis, we learn that Negro laborers were forced out of employment by the threats of the American Federation of Labor-made by the Business Agent against the contractors. Jobs were picketed by Negroes and whites who were not affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. They were attacked by three car loads of American Federation of Labor representatives.<p>

<a name="17"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> On the Homer Phillips Hospital, a new Negro municipal hospital in St. Louis, the General Tile Company employed a Negro as tile setter; whereupon all the A. F of L. men walked off and tied up the job.<p>

<a name="18"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> As a result an organization has been formed known as the "Allied Building Contractors Association" in St. Louis composed of both Negro and white contractors who will not limit the employment of any particular race, but will extend the employment opportunity to all people on the basis of competency and efficiency.<p>

<a name="19"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The Homer Phillips Hospital project has been closed and nailed up for eight weeks, according to our informant, on account of the unwillingness on the part of the membership of the American Federation of Labor to work on the same job with Negroes.<p>

<a name="20"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> In the midst of all that is being done, by, for, with or against organized labor, the Negro stands aghast. Having little or no information as to the history sof different organized labor movements--only a faint understanding concerning the technique of collective bargaining; in a more or less detached manner, the Negro wage earners of America stand and look at organized labor.<p>

<h2>Negro Wage Earners and Trade Unions</h2> <p>

<h3>BY WILLIAM GREEN </h3><p>

<table align=right bgcolor="#cccccc" width=250 height=100 cellpadding=10><td><I>The President of the American Federation of Labor ventures some advice to Negro workers and their role in the present crisis.<p>

--The Editor</I></table><p>
<ol>
<a name="1"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> DURING the past five years Negro wage earners have been turning to the organized labor movement with new conviction. They are becoming responsible union members, sharing the benefits and hardships of union endeavor. With increasing frequency they have appeared in Washington as representatives of wage earners for the business of code making. These developments are evidence of substantial progress in the growing acceptance of responsibility on the part of Negro workers.<p>

<a name="2"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The American Federation of Labor sees in this development the beginning of a new era for wage-earners. Membership in a trade union represents a desire to keep step with economic and social progress and acceptance of the responsibilities for working out progress for wage-earners. This constructive attitude means that both white and Negro workers will join ranks in determining and maintaining minimum and maximum standards. When any one group however small accepts substandard conditions, the wage structure for all is undermined. Although the labor movement has had every sympathy for the handicaps of Negro workers, willingness on the part of some to undercut standards of compensation and workmanship, have been the source of practical difficulties. While we appreciated the reasons for the situation, it is with frank gladness and relief we note the progress of these workers beyond the necessities which prevented them from working common cause with us.<p>

<a name="3"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> There is an immediate problem in many industries with which the advanced groups may cope-the Southern differential which in so many cases means the determination of the industry to depress Negro wages. Opportunity for Negro wage earners lies not in undercutting wages for white workers but in cooperating for the elimination of such a differential.<p>

<a name="4"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> Negro workers need high wages so that they may increase their reserves. In periods like the past five years, the reserves of many have been exhausted. The unemployment relief census taken by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration in October 1933, showed that 18 per cent of the Negroes of the country were on relief as contrasted with 9.5 per cent of whites. In order to build up reserves for the emergencies of life, Negroes must have higher pay for their work and set aside a fixed amount for savings and emergency purposes. You want just as good homes and as good opportunities for your children as any other citizens of this country: The way to do it is organization for the purpose of negotiating a work contract with your employer that will provide higher wages and better work conditions. Your union executive will be responsible for negotiation of the work contract and for seeing that it is enforced. You pay dues into your union to pay your union executives and the expenses of the organization. If your dues are high enough the union may set up union benefits. During the year of 1933, the unions of this country paid out over 40 millions of dollars for death, sickness, unemployment, old age, disability, and other benefits. All of this was in addition to assuring members the highest wages paid in industries and securing the five-day week for the majority.<p>

<a name="5"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> All those, Negro wage earners who want to undertake seriously the job of increasing their incomes and assuring themselves of definite work rights, should join the union of their fellow workers or apply to the American Federation of Labor for a charter.<p>

<a name="6"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> You can better yourselves if you are ready to make the effort. It will require courage and endurance, but what others have done you can do. I know many Negro miners who are splendid union workers, who can always be counted on for most faithful union responsibilities.<p>

<a name="7"><font color="#666666"><li></a></font> The union is the first step.
