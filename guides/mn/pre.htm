<H3>Preface</H3></center>

<a name="1"><font color="#cccccc"><li></a></font>THE Minnesota unit of the Federal Writers' Project offers its contribution to the American Guide Series in a spirit of deep humility. We frankly admit that the net result of our work falls far short of the book we visualized in November 1935 when we started out so enthusiastically on its preparation. At that time we had little conception of the complexities of our task. Even less did we realize the extravagance of our hope of compressing between two covers a State 84,000 square miles in area, whose interests and resources were as varied as its topography.<P>


<a name="2"><font color="#cccccc"><li></a></font>An avalanche of facts, actual and near, began to pour into the State office. Even after each had been tested we still had enough to make a series rather than one volume. The weeding out was a long and often painful process. Had not Dr. Folwell required four large volumes for the history of Minnesota? We must tell the story, and tell it fairly, in a single essay. Communities that merited a chapter at least, must be squeezed into a few lines. Local pride, however justified, must be sternly repressed. From sins of commission we hope to have guarded ourselves fairly well with the help of consulting authorities. But for our sins of omission we have no defense other than the imposed space limitations.<P>


<a name="3"><font color="#cccccc"><li></a></font>If, despite its shortcomings, the book has merit--and we may as well admit we think it has some--credit is due largely to the generous cooperation we have received on all sides. To the many volunteers who sent us local stories and photographs we offer our profound thanks, and beg their forgiveness and leniency for our enforced treatment of their material.<P>


<a name="4"><font color="#cccccc"><li></a></font>Outstanding was the help given us by the University of Minnesota, whose department heads not only read our manuscripts and proffered invaluable suggestions, but permitted us to turn to them again and again as our court of last appeal; by the Minnesota Historical Society, its head and staff, who gave so generously of their knowledge and records; by the State Department of Education, whose commissioner rescued us in one of our darkest moments; by all those librarians to whom we fear we were a persistent trial; by the unfailing confidence and support we received from our State Administrator. We hope that in the Minnesota Guide they will find Something to justify the time and sympathy they gave so freely.<P>
